## FunctionDef build_language_lib
**Function Overview**: The `build_language_lib` function is designed to construct a language library specifically for Python parsing, storing it within a designated build directory.

**Parameters**:
- **referencer_content**: Not applicable. This parameter indicates if there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component. In this case, no parameters are explicitly defined in the function signature.
- **reference_letter**: Not applicable. This parameter shows if there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship. No such parameter exists in the function signature.

**Return Values**: The `build_language_lib` function does not return any explicit values. Its primary purpose is to execute the `Language.build_library` method and produce a side effect by creating a library file.

**Detailed Explanation**: 
The `build_language_lib` function orchestrates the creation of a language parsing library for Python using a specified Tree-Sitter package. The process involves invoking the `Language.build_library` method with two arguments:
1. A string indicating the path where the resulting shared object (`.so`) file will be stored, in this case, `'ccfinder/cc_extractor/build/python-lang-parser.so'`.
2. A list containing one or more paths to Tree-Sitter language packages that should be included in the library. Here, only the `'ts_package/tree-sitter-python'` package is specified.

**Relationship Description**: 
Since neither `referencer_content` nor `reference_letter` are applicable (as no parameters related to these concepts exist), there is no functional relationship described within the function signature or documentation provided. The function operates independently based on its internal logic and does not explicitly interact with other components through defined parameters.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**: 
- **Limitations**: The current implementation is hardcoded for building a Python language parser library, which limits flexibility if additional languages need to be supported.
- **Edge Cases**: There are no explicit checks or error handling in the function. If the specified paths do not exist or there are issues with the Tree-Sitter package, the function will likely raise an exception without providing detailed feedback.
- **Refactoring Suggestions**:
  - **Parameterize Paths**: Introduce parameters to allow customization of the output path and input packages. This would enhance reusability and adaptability.
    ```python
    def build_language_lib(output_path, language_packages):
        Language.build_library(
            output_path,
            language_packages
        )
    ```
  - **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage potential issues during library creation, such as missing files or incompatible packages. This could involve try-except blocks and logging.
  - **Logging**: Add logging statements to track the progress of library creation and provide feedback on success or failure.

By implementing these suggestions, the function can become more robust, flexible, and maintainable, aligning with best practices in software development.
