## FunctionDef build_language_lib
**build_language_lib**: This function constructs a language library specifically for parsing Python code using Tree-sitter. The generated library is stored in a predefined directory within the project structure.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function `build_language_lib` is designed to automate the process of building a shared object file (`.so`) that encapsulates the parsing capabilities for Python code. It leverages the Tree-sitter library, which is a powerful tool for creating parsers for programming languages. The function calls `Language.build_library`, a method provided by the Tree-sitter Python bindings, to generate this parser.

The first argument passed to `Language.build_library` specifies the output path and filename of the generated shared object file. In this case, the library will be stored at 'ccfinder/cc_extractor/build/python-lang-parser.so'. This location is within the project's build directory, indicating that it is intended for use in a development or testing environment.

The second argument is a list containing paths to the Tree-sitter grammar files for the languages that the parser should support. Here, only one language is included: 'ts_package/tree-sitter-python', which refers to the Tree-sitter grammar for Python. This means the generated library will be capable of parsing Python code according to the rules defined in this grammar.

Note: Usage points.
Developers can use this function as part of their build process to ensure that a up-to-date parser library is available for applications that rely on parsing Python code. It simplifies the integration of Tree-sitter parsers by abstracting away the details of building the shared object file, making it easier to maintain and update language support in projects. Beginners can use this function as an example of how to set up a Tree-sitter parser for a specific programming language within their own projects.
