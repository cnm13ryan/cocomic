## FunctionDef load_parser(lang, lib_path)
**load_parser**: This function initializes a parser object configured to work with a specified programming language by loading the appropriate language library.

parameters:
· lang: A string representing the name of the programming language for which the parser is being set up.
· lib_path: An optional string specifying the path to the directory containing the language libraries. It defaults to DEFAULT_LIB_PATH if not provided.

Code Description: The function begins by creating a Language object using the specified library path and language name. This Language object encapsulates all necessary information about the syntax and semantics of the given programming language. Following this, a Parser object is instantiated. The parser's set_language method is then called with the previously created Language object as its argument, configuring the parser to understand and process code written in the specified language. Finally, the configured parser object is returned.

Note: This function is crucial for setting up parsing capabilities tailored to different programming languages, enabling accurate analysis or transformation of source code files.

Output Example: Assuming a call to load_parser('python', '/path/to/language/libs'), the output would be a Parser object that has been set up with the Python language library located at '/path/to/language/libs'. This parser can then be used to parse and analyze Python source code.
## FunctionDef get_file_content(file_path)
**get_file_content**: This function reads the content of a file specified by its path and returns it as a single string.

parameters:
· file_path: A string representing the path to the file whose contents need to be read.

Code Description: The function `get_file_content` takes one argument, `file_path`, which is expected to be a valid path to a file on the filesystem. It opens the file in read mode and reads all lines from the file using the `readlines()` method. This method returns a list where each element is a line in the file. The function then joins these lines into a single string using the `join()` method with an empty string as the separator, effectively concatenating all lines without any additional characters between them. Finally, it returns this concatenated string.

Note: It's important to ensure that the file path provided exists and is accessible; otherwise, the function will raise an IOError. Additionally, since the entire content of the file is read into memory at once, this approach may not be suitable for very large files due to potential memory constraints.

Output Example: If the file located at `file_path` contains the following lines:
```
Hello,
World!
```

The output of `get_file_content(file_path)` would be:
```
Hello,World!
```
## FunctionDef get_parse_context(parser, contents, lang)
**get_parse_context**: This function generates a parsing context for Python source code by utilizing a parser to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the given code contents. It then initializes a `PythonCodeContext` object with this AST and the original code, which can be used for further analysis or transformation.

parameters:
· parser: An instance of a parser capable of generating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from source code.
· contents: A string containing the Python source code to be parsed.
· lang: A string indicating the programming language of the source code. In this context, it is expected to be "python".

Code Description: The function begins by converting the provided `contents` string into bytes using UTF-8 encoding. This byte representation is then passed to the `parse` method of the `parser` object to generate an AST. Following the parsing process, a `PythonCodeContext` object is instantiated with the generated AST and the original source code as arguments. The `PythonCodeContext` class is specifically designed for handling Python code, providing methods to parse the code into structured line-token pairs and determine if lines contain actual code.

Note: This function is typically used in scenarios where detailed analysis or transformation of Python source code is required. It serves as a foundational step by preparing the source code in a structured format that can be easily manipulated or queried.

Output Example: A possible return value from `get_parse_context` would be an instance of `PythonCodeContext`. Assuming the input code is "def foo():\n    return 42", the `parsed_lines` attribute within this context object might look like:

[
    CodeLineTokens(line_no=0, tokens=[Token(node=<TSNode object>, code_bytes=b'def foo():')], text='def foo():'),
    CodeLineTokens(line_no=1, tokens=[Token(node=<TSNode object>, code_bytes=b'    return 42'), Token(node=<TSNode object>, code_bytes=b'\n')], text='    return 42\n')
]

This output represents the source code broken down into lines, with each line containing a list of tokens that make up the code. Each token is associated with its corresponding node in the AST and the byte representation of the token within the original source code.
