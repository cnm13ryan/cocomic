### FunctionDef __init__(self, node, context)
**__init__**: This function initializes an instance of the PythonFunction class. It takes a node representing a function definition from the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and a context object that provides additional information about the code.

parameters:
· node: A TSNode object that represents a function definition in the AST.
· context: An instance of PythonCodeContext, which contains parsed AST and source code details specific to Python.

Code Description: The __init__ method starts by calling the constructor of the superclass using super().__init__(node, context). This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed. Following this, an assertion checks whether the type of the node is "function_definition". If the node does not represent a function definition, an AssertionError will be raised, indicating that the object was incorrectly instantiated with a non-function node.

The method relies on the context parameter to provide necessary information about the code structure and tokens, which are essential for further processing or analysis of the function. The assertion serves as a safeguard to ensure that only nodes representing function definitions are processed by instances of this class.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of PythonFunction with a node from the AST that represents a function definition and a valid PythonCodeContext object. This setup is typically used in scenarios where functions need to be analyzed, transformed, or extracted from Python source code based on their structure in the AST.
***
### FunctionDef colon_line_no(self)
**colon_line_no**: This function identifies and returns the line number of the colon (:) character within a given node's children, typically used to locate the end of a function signature in Python source code.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly; it operates on the instance variable `self.node` which is expected to be set with an appropriate AST node before calling this method.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function iterates through each child node of `self.node`. It checks if the type of a child node is a colon (":"). Upon finding such a node, it assigns it to `colon_node` and breaks out of the loop. An assertion ensures that a colon node was indeed found; if not, an AssertionError will be raised. Finally, the function returns the line number where the colon is located by accessing `start_point[0]` of the `colon_node`. The `start_point` attribute typically contains a tuple with two elements: the line number and the column index.

Note: Usage points.
This function is utilized within the `functions` method of the `PythonASTFileContext` class to determine the line number of the colon in each function definition node. This information helps in extracting the function signature accurately by identifying where the parameters list ends with a colon before the function body begins.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming that the `self.node` represents a Python function definition, and the colon separating the function name and parameters from the function body is located at line 5 in the source file, the function would return:
5

This indicates that the colon character is found on line number 5.
***
### FunctionDef block(self)
**block**: This function retrieves the block node from a Python function's syntax tree representation. The block typically contains the main body of the function, excluding any header comments and docstrings.

parameters:
· None: This function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `block` method is designed to identify and return the last child element of the current node in the syntax tree if it is a "block" type. It first checks whether the last child of the `self.node` (which represents the entire function) is indeed a block by comparing its `type` attribute. If the last child is not a block, the method raises a `RuntimeError`, providing an error message that includes details about the node and its children. This ensures that the function only returns nodes that are correctly identified as blocks, maintaining integrity in the syntax tree parsing process.

Note: The `block` method is crucial for other methods within the class, such as `get_docstring` and `body`, which rely on accurately identifying the block to extract docstrings or the main body of the function, respectively.

Output Example: Assuming the function node has a structure where its last child is a block containing the function's main code, the method would return this block node. For instance, if the function in question is defined as follows:

```python
def example_function():
    # This is a header comment
    """This is a docstring."""
    x = 10
    y = 20
    return x + y
```

The `block` method would return the node representing the block containing the lines `x = 10`, `y = 20`, and `return x + y`.
***
### FunctionDef header_comments(self)
**header_comments**: This function retrieves header comments from a Python function node. Header comments are those placed immediately after the function definition line but before the function body, which serve as additional documentation not recognized by parsers as docstrings.

**parameters**:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly. It operates on the instance's `node` attribute, which should represent a Python function node in the syntax tree.

**Code Description**: Detailed analysis and description.
The function begins by accessing the children of the current node (`self.node.children`). These children include all elements that are direct descendants of the function definition, such as parameters, colons, comments, and the function body. The goal is to identify any comments placed between the colon (which signifies the end of the function signature) and the start of the function block.

The function iterates over these children to find the index of the colon (`:`). This is crucial because all header comments must appear after this token and before the actual function body. If no colon is found, a `RuntimeError` is raised, indicating that the node does not represent a valid Python function definition.

Once the colon's position is identified, the function scans through the subsequent nodes up to but excluding the last child (which typically represents the function block). During this scan, it checks each node's type. If a node is of type "comment", it is added to the `comments` list. This list will eventually contain all header comments associated with the function.

**Note**: Usage points.
This function is particularly useful in scenarios where additional documentation about a function is provided outside of the standard docstring format, such as when developers prefer to place brief notes or reminders directly above their code blocks for clarity or context.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Given the following Python function:
```python
def example_function(x):
    # This is an example header comment
    # It provides additional information about the function
    return x + 1
```
The `header_comments` method would return a list containing two `TSNode` objects, each representing one of the comments above the function body:
```python
[
    TSNode(type="comment", text="# This is an example header comment"),
    TSNode(type="comment", text="# It provides additional information about the function")
]
```
Each `TSNode` in this list encapsulates details about a comment, including its type and the exact text content.
***
### FunctionDef get_docstring(self)
**get_docstring**: This function retrieves the docstring node from a Python function's syntax tree representation. It searches within the block of the function to find the first string node that is likely to be a docstring.

parameters:
· None: This function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `get_docstring` method employs a depth-first search (DFS) approach to locate the first string node within the function's block. It defines an inner function, `dfs_find_docstring`, which recursively checks each child of the current node. If it encounters a node of type "string", it returns that node as the potential docstring. The method then validates whether the retrieved string is enclosed in triple quotes (either """ or '''), confirming its status as a valid Python docstring. If such a node is found and validated, `get_docstring` returns this node; otherwise, it returns None.

Note: This function is crucial for extracting documentation directly from the source code, which can be used for generating API documentation, tooltips in IDEs, or other automated documentation tools. It relies on the `block` method to identify the main body of the function and the `get_node_text` method from `BaseCodeContext` to extract the text content of the docstring node.

Output Example: Assuming a Python function defined as follows:

```python
def example_function():
    """This is an example docstring."""
    x = 10
    y = 20
    return x + y
```

The `get_docstring` method would return the TSNode representing the string node `"This is an example docstring."`. If no valid docstring is found, it would return None.
#### FunctionDef dfs_find_docstring(node)
**dfs_find_docstring**: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find a docstring within a given node structure, typically used in parsing abstract syntax trees (ASTs). It recursively traverses the tree starting from the provided node and returns the first string node it encounters, which is assumed to be the docstring.

**parameters**:
· node: The current node in the AST being examined. This node should have a 'type' attribute indicating its type and a 'children' list containing its child nodes.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the current node's type is "string". If so, it returns this node as it has found what is assumed to be the docstring. If the node does not contain any children (i.e., `len(node.children) == 0`), the function concludes that there are no further nodes to explore in this branch and returns None. Otherwise, the function proceeds with a recursive call to itself using the first child of the current node (`node.children[0]`). This process continues until either a string node is found or all branches have been exhausted without finding one.

**Note**: The function assumes that docstrings are represented as string nodes in the AST and that they appear as the first child node in the relevant branch. It does not handle cases where multiple docstring candidates might exist or where docstrings could be located elsewhere within the structure.

**Output Example**: If the input node is part of an AST representing a Python function with a docstring, and the docstring is the first string encountered during the DFS traversal, the function will return that string node. For instance, if the node represents a function definition with a docstring "This is a sample function", the output would be the node containing this string. If no such string node is found, the function returns None.
***
***
### FunctionDef get_documentation_end(comments, docstring_node)
**get_documentation_end**: This function determines the line number at which the documentation (comments and docstring) of a Python function ends.

parameters:
· comments: A list of TSNode objects representing comment nodes associated with the function.
· docstring_node: A single TSNode object representing the docstring node of the function, if it exists. If there is no docstring, this parameter can be None.

Code Description: The function starts by checking if both the comments list and the docstring_node are empty or None. In such a case, it returns -1, indicating that there is no documentation to consider. If there are comments or a docstring, it creates a new list called doc_nodes containing all comment nodes from the comments list. If a docstring_node is provided (not None), it appends this node to the doc_nodes list as well.

Next, the function calculates the maximum end line number among all nodes in the doc_nodes list by accessing each node's end_point attribute, which contains a tuple with the line and column numbers where the node ends. The function then returns this maximum line number, representing the last line of the documentation for the function.

Note: This function is used within the body method of the PythonFunction class to determine the starting point of the actual code body by finding the end of all associated comments and docstrings.

Output Example: If a function has comments ending on line 5 and a docstring ending on line 7, get_documentation_end will return 7. This indicates that the documentation ends on line 7, and the function's body starts from line 8.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and using the project. It is intended to be clear and concise, ensuring that both developers and beginners can effectively utilize the system.
***
### FunctionDef name(self)
**name**: Retrieves the name of a function from its AST node.
parameters:
· self: The instance of the PythonFunction class, which contains the AST node representing the function.

Code Description: The `name` method is designed to extract and return the name of a function defined within an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node. It begins by accessing the first child of the node, which should represent either a 'def' or 'async' keyword in Python syntax. An assertion checks that this child node's type is indeed 'def' or 'async'. Depending on whether the function is synchronous ('def') or asynchronous ('async'), it identifies the correct index for the function name node among the children of the current node.

The method then accesses the identified function name node and asserts that its type is an 'identifier', which signifies a valid Python identifier (i.e., the function's name). Finally, it uses the `get_node_text` method from the `BaseCodeContext` class to retrieve and return the textual content of this identifier node as the function name.

In case any exception occurs during this process, such as an unexpected node type or structure, the method logs an error message using a logger (not shown in the provided code snippet) and returns an empty string instead of raising an exception. This approach ensures that the method handles errors gracefully without interrupting the flow of the program.

Note: The `name` method is typically used within a larger context where function definitions are being analyzed or processed, such as in static code analysis tools or refactoring utilities.

Output Example: Assuming there is a function defined as `def example_function():`, calling `name()` on the corresponding PythonFunction instance would return `'example_function'`. If an error occurs during extraction, it would return an empty string.
***
### FunctionDef decorator(self)
**decorator**: This function retrieves the decorator associated with a given Python function node if it exists.
parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters; it operates on the instance's `node` attribute.

Code Description: The `decorator` method is designed to identify and return the text of a decorator that precedes a function definition in the source code. It first checks if there is a previous sibling node to the current function node (`self.node`). If no such node exists, it returns an empty string. If a previous sibling does exist, the method then checks whether this sibling's type is "decorator". If it is, the method uses `self.context.get_node_text(prev_sibling_node)` to extract and return the text content of the decorator node. This function is particularly useful for analyzing Python code where decorators are used to modify or enhance function behavior.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to programmatically inspect or process decorators applied to functions, such as in static analysis tools, refactoring utilities, or documentation generators.

Output Example: If the function definition is preceded by a decorator like `@staticmethod`, the method would return `"@staticmethod"`. If there is no preceding decorator, it would return an empty string.
***
### FunctionDef parameters(self)
**parameters**: Retrieves a list of function input arguments along with their types and default values.
**parameters**:
· No parameters: This method does not accept any external parameters.

**Code Description**: The `parameters` method is designed to extract detailed information about the input arguments of a Python function node. It first identifies whether the function definition is synchronous or asynchronous by checking the type of the first child node, which should be either "def" or "async". Based on this identification, it locates the parameters node within the function's children.

The method then retrieves the raw text content of the parameters node using `self.context.get_node_text`. This text is processed to remove parentheses and any newline characters, leaving only a comma-separated list of parameter definitions. Each parameter definition can include a name, type, and default value in various combinations (e.g., `param`, `param=value`, `param:type`, `param:type=value`).

The method iterates over each raw parameter string, parsing it to extract the name, type, and default value where applicable. These details are stored in a dictionary for each parameter and added to a list of parameters.

**Note**: The function handles exceptions that may occur during the process of extracting and parsing the parameters, logging any errors encountered and returning an empty list if an error occurs.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
[
    {"name": "param1", "type": "", "default_value": ""},
    {"name": "param2", "type": "int", "default_value": "10"},
    {"name": "param3", "type": "str", "default_value": "'example'"},
    {"name": "param4", "type": "List[int]", "default_value": "[1, 2, 3]"}
]
***
### FunctionDef return_type(self)
**return_type**: Retrieves the return type of a Python function from its abstract syntax tree (AST) node.
parameters:
· self: The instance of the class containing this method, which should have an attribute `node` representing the AST node of the function and an attribute `context` providing access to methods like `get_node_text`.

Code Description: This method aims to extract the return type annotation from a Python function's AST node. It first asserts that the first child of the node is either 'def' or 'async', indicating a standard or asynchronous function definition, respectively. Depending on whether the function is synchronous ('def') or asynchronous ('async'), it adjusts the index used to locate the return type node in the children list. The method then checks if the preceding node is an arrow ('->') and the target node is of type 'type', ensuring that the syntax for a return type annotation is correctly formed. If these conditions are met, it uses the `get_node_text` method from the `context` attribute to retrieve and return the text content of the return type node. If any assertion fails or an exception occurs during this process, the method returns an empty string.

Note: This function assumes that the AST node provided is correctly structured as a Python function definition. It handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions but does not support more complex scenarios such as multiple return types or conditional return annotations.

Output Example: For a function defined as `def example() -> int:`, the method would return `"int"`. If there is no return type annotation, it would return an empty string `""`.
***
### FunctionDef return_statements(self)
**return_statements**: This function identifies and collects all unique return statements within a given node of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It is designed to traverse the AST, specifically targeting nodes that represent return statements, and then extracting their textual content.

**parameters**:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it relies on the internal state of the object, particularly `self.node` and `self.context`.

**Code Description**: The function initializes an empty list called `return_stmt_nodes` to store nodes that represent return statements. It defines a nested callback function `_cb` that appends each encountered return statement node to `return_stmt_nodes`. The function then performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the AST starting from `self.node`, using `_dfs` and specifying "return_statement" as the type of node to look for. After collecting all relevant nodes, it iterates over them, using `self.context.get_node_text(node)` to extract the textual content of each return statement node. These texts are stored in `return_stmt_texts`. Finally, the function returns a list of unique return statements by converting `return_stmt_texts` into a set and back to a list.

**Note**: This function is particularly useful for analyzing Python code to understand what values or expressions functions might return. It can be used in static analysis tools, refactoring utilities, or documentation generators that need to summarize the output behavior of functions.

**Output Example**: 
```
['return result', 'return None', 'return x + y']
```
#### FunctionDef _cb(n)
**_cb**: This function appends a node to a list named `return_stmt_nodes`. It is likely used within a context where nodes representing return statements are collected for further processing.

parameters:
· n: A node object, presumably representing a return statement in an abstract syntax tree (AST).

Code Description: The function `_cb` takes one parameter, `n`, which is expected to be a node. This node is then appended to the list `return_stmt_nodes`. The purpose of this function is to gather all return statement nodes into a single list for potential analysis or transformation later in the program.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where an AST traversal is performed and return statements need to be collected for specific processing, such as static code analysis or refactoring tools. It's important that `return_stmt_nodes` is defined in the scope where `_cb` is called; otherwise, a NameError will occur.

Output Example: If `n` represents a return statement node with the value 5, after calling `_cb(n)`, `return_stmt_nodes` would contain this node as its first element. Assuming further calls to `_cb` with other nodes, `return_stmt_nodes` would accumulate all these nodes in the order they were appended.
***
***
### FunctionDef assignments(self)
**assignments**: This function retrieves all assignment statements within a given Python function node from an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

**parameters**:
· None: The `assignments` method does not take any explicit parameters. It operates on the instance's context and node attributes.

**Code Description**: The `assignments` method is designed to identify and extract assignment statements from a specific function within a parsed Python codebase. It initializes an empty list, `assignment_stmt_nodes`, to store nodes that represent assignment operations. A callback function, `assignment_cb`, is defined to append each encountered assignment node to this list.

The method then invokes `_dfs` (Depth-First Search), passing the current node, a list containing the string "assignment" to specify the type of nodes to look for, and the callback function. This traversal ensures that all assignment statements within the function are captured.

After collecting the relevant nodes, the method constructs a list of tuples, `assignments`, where each tuple contains two elements: the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of an assignment statement. These values are extracted using the `get_node_text` method from the context object, which retrieves the text content of specific nodes in the AST.

The function returns this list of tuples, providing a clear representation of all assignments within the function.

**Note**: This function is particularly useful for static code analysis tasks where understanding variable assignments and their values is crucial. It can be used to analyze data flow, identify dependencies between variables, or perform transformations on specific parts of the code.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
[
    ('x', '10'),
    ('y', 'x + 5'),
    ('result', 'calculate(y)')
]
```
#### FunctionDef assignment_cb(n)
**assignment_cb**: This function appends a node representing an assignment statement to a list named `assignment_stmt_nodes`.

parameters:
· n: A node object, presumably from an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents an assignment statement.

Code Description: The function `assignment_cb` takes one parameter, `n`, which is expected to be a node in an AST. This node specifically represents an assignment operation within the source code being analyzed or transformed. The function's purpose is to collect these assignment nodes into a list called `assignment_stmt_nodes`. By appending each assignment node (`n`) to this list, the function facilitates further processing or analysis of all assignment statements encountered during the traversal or transformation of the AST.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where one needs to gather and possibly analyze or manipulate all assignment operations in a given codebase. This could be part of a larger tool for static code analysis, refactoring, or transformation tasks. The function assumes that `assignment_stmt_nodes` is defined in an outer scope accessible to this function, which would typically be the case if `assignment_cb` is used as a callback within a traversal mechanism over the AST.
***
***
### FunctionDef find_all(context)
**find_all**: This function searches through a Python source code's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to locate all function definitions and returns them as instances of `PythonFunction`.

parameters:
· context: An instance of `PythonCodeContext` that contains the parsed AST (`tree`) and the original source code (`code`).

Code Description: The `find_all` function begins by accessing the root node of the AST from the provided `context`. It initializes an empty list named `functions` to store instances of `PythonFunction` objects. A nested depth-first search (DFS) function, `dfs`, is defined within `find_all`. This `dfs` function traverses each node in the AST recursively. If a node's type matches "function_definition", it signifies that the node represents a Python function definition. In this case, an instance of `PythonFunction` is created using the current node and the original context, and appended to the `functions` list. The `dfs` function then proceeds to iterate over all children of the current node, applying itself recursively to each child. After the DFS traversal completes, the `find_all` function returns the populated `functions` list containing all identified functions.

Note: This function is useful for analyzing or transforming Python code by allowing developers to easily access and manipulate all function definitions within a given source file.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the return value from calling `find_all` could be a list of `PythonFunction` objects, each representing a different function defined in the source code. For instance:

[
    PythonFunction(node=<TSNode object>, context=<PythonCodeContext object>),
    PythonFunction(node=<TSNode object>, context=<PythonCodeContext object>)
]
#### FunctionDef dfs(node)
**dfs**: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree structure represented by nodes of type `TSNode`. It specifically looks for nodes of type "function_definition" to create instances of `PythonFunction` and appends them to a list named `functions`.

parameters:
· node: An instance of `TSNode`, representing the current node in the tree being traversed.

Code Description: The function starts by checking if the type of the current node is "function_definition". If it is, an instance of `PythonFunction` is created using this node and a context (presumably provided elsewhere in the code), and this new `PythonFunction` object is appended to the list `functions`. After handling the current node, the function iterates over all children of the current node. For each child, it recursively calls itself, effectively traversing the tree in a depth-first manner.

Note: This function assumes that there is an external list named `functions` and a variable named `context` available in its scope. The `TSNode` type likely represents nodes in an abstract syntax tree (AST) of Python code, where each node corresponds to a syntactic construct such as functions, classes, statements, etc. This DFS traversal is useful for analyzing or processing all function definitions within the given AST. Developers should ensure that `functions` and `context` are properly defined before calling this function to avoid runtime errors.
