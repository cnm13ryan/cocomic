## ClassDef PythonClass
**PythonClass**: Represents a Python class definition within a given syntax tree node, providing access to various properties of the class such as its name, arguments, instance variables, and class variables.

**attributes**:
· node: A TSNode object representing the class definition in the syntax tree.
· context: An instance of PythonCodeContext that provides methods for retrieving text from nodes and performing depth-first searches within the syntax tree.

**Code Description**: The `PythonClass` class is designed to encapsulate details about a Python class defined in a source file. It initializes with a node representing the class definition and a context object that facilitates interaction with the syntax tree. The class provides several properties for accessing different aspects of the class:

- **colon_line_no**: Returns the line number where the colon (:) following the class name is located, indicating the start of the class body.
- **arguments**: Retrieves the list of arguments specified in the class definition, which can include base classes or other parameters. It processes the argument list by stripping unnecessary characters and splitting it into individual elements.
- **name**: Extracts and returns the name of the class from its syntax tree node.
- **instance_variable**: Identifies and lists all instance variables defined within the `__init__` method of the class, which are typically assigned using the `self` keyword.
- **class_variable**: Collects and categorizes all class variables declared outside any methods but within the class body. These variables are shared among all instances of the class.

The class also includes a static method, `find_all`, which searches through the entire syntax tree to locate all class definitions and returns a list of `PythonClass` objects representing each one.

**Note**: This class is typically used in conjunction with a PythonCodeContext object that provides necessary methods for parsing and navigating the syntax tree. It is particularly useful for static code analysis, documentation generation, or refactoring tools that need to understand the structure and properties of classes within Python source files.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the `instance_variable` property's return value could be:
```
['self.name', 'self.age']
```

This indicates that the class has two instance variables named `name` and `age`, both prefixed with `self` to denote they are part of the class instances.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, node, context)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the PythonClass, ensuring it represents a valid class definition node within the given context.

parameters:
· node: A TSNode object representing a node in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This node should correspond to a class definition.
· context: An instance of PythonCodeContext that provides the necessary context for parsing and analyzing Python code.

Code Description: The __init__ method is responsible for setting up a new instance of the PythonClass. It takes two parameters: `node` and `context`. The `node` parameter must be a TSNode object specifically representing a class definition in the AST. This ensures that the PythonClass instance accurately reflects a class within the source code.

The `context` parameter is an instance of PythonCodeContext, which holds essential information about the parsed Python code, including the AST and the original source code string. By passing this context to the PythonClass, the method allows for further analysis and manipulation of the class definition in relation to its broader context within the codebase.

An assertion checks that the `node`'s type is indeed "class_definition". This validation step ensures that the instance of PythonClass is correctly initialized with a node representing a class, preventing errors or misinterpretations later in the program's execution.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of PythonClass by providing a TSNode object corresponding to a class definition and a PythonCodeContext object containing relevant parsing information. This setup allows for detailed analysis and transformation of Python classes within their broader code context.

### FunctionDef colon_line_no(self)
**colon_line_no**: This function identifies the line number of a colon (:) within the syntax tree node associated with an instance of PythonClass. It iterates through the children nodes of the current node to find the first occurrence of a colon and returns its line number.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters as it operates on the internal state of the PythonClass instance, specifically using `self.node` which is expected to be an object representing a syntax tree node with children.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function starts by initializing `colon_node` to `None`. It then enters a loop that iterates over each child node (`c`) in `self.node.children`. During each iteration, it checks if the type of the current child node is a colon (":"). If such a node is found, it assigns this node to `colon_node` and breaks out of the loop. After exiting the loop, an assertion is made to ensure that `colon_node` is not `None`, indicating that a colon was indeed found among the children nodes. Finally, the function returns the line number of the colon node by accessing its `start_point[0]` attribute.

Note: Usage points.
This function is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine the exact location of a colon within a specific part of Python code represented as an abstract syntax tree (AST). It can be particularly helpful for tools that analyze or manipulate Python source code, such as linters, formatters, or custom parsers.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If the function were called on a node representing a line of Python code like `def my_function():`, and assuming the colon is located at line 5 in the file, the function would return `5`.
***
### FunctionDef arguments(self)
**arguments**: This function retrieves the argument list of a class definition from its abstract syntax tree (AST) node.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the internal state of the `PythonClass` instance, specifically the AST node representing the class and the context object used to extract text from nodes.

Code Description: The `arguments` method is designed to parse the argument list associated with a class definition in Python code. It begins by initializing an empty list named `args`. The function then attempts to access specific children of the internal AST node (`self.node`). The first child should be a node representing the class definition itself, which is verified using an assertion. Following this, it accesses the third child node, expected to represent the argument list of the class. Another assertion checks that this node indeed represents an argument list.

The method then uses the `get_node_text` function from the context object (`self.context`) to extract the raw text content of the argument list node. This raw string is stripped of parentheses and newline characters, and spaces are removed to facilitate splitting into individual arguments. The resulting string is split by commas to create a list of argument names.

If any part of this process fails (e.g., if the AST structure does not match expectations), the function catches the exception and returns an empty list without further processing.

Note: This method assumes that the class definition node has been correctly identified and passed to the `PythonClass` instance. It is crucial for the internal state (`self.node`) to accurately represent a class definition in the AST.

Output Example: For a class defined as `class MyClass(arg1, arg2):`, the function would return `['arg1', 'arg2']`. If there are no arguments or if an error occurs during processing, it returns an empty list `[]`.
***
### FunctionDef name(self)
**name**: Retrieves the name of a Python class from its AST node.
parameters:
· self: The instance of the PythonClass object, which contains the AST node representing the class.

Code Description: The function `name` is designed to extract and return the name of a Python class by examining its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node. It begins by accessing the first child of the node, which should represent the 'class' keyword in the syntax tree. An assertion checks that this node indeed represents a class; if not, an error message is generated detailing the unexpected type.

Following the validation of the class node, the function proceeds to access the second child of the AST node, which corresponds to the identifier (name) of the class. Another assertion ensures that this node is of type 'identifier'. If it is, the function uses the `get_node_text` method from the context object to retrieve and return the text content of this node, effectively extracting the class name.

In cases where any part of the process fails—such as if the node structure does not match expectations or an error occurs during execution—the function catches these exceptions and returns `None`, indicating that the class name could not be determined.

Note: This function is typically used within a larger context where Python classes are being analyzed, such as in code refactoring tools, static analysis utilities, or documentation generators. It relies on the correct structure of AST nodes representing Python classes and assumes that the context object provides a method to extract text from these nodes.

Output Example: If the function is called on an instance of `PythonClass` initialized with an AST node for a class named 'MyClass', the output would be:
```
'MyClass'
```
***
### FunctionDef instance_variable(self)
**instance_variable**: This function retrieves the instance variables defined within a Python class by analyzing its constructor method (`__init__`).

**parameters**:
· self: The instance of the `PythonClass` object for which instance variables need to be extracted.

**Code Description**: The `instance_variable` function is designed to identify and return a list of strings representing the names of instance variables defined in the class's `__init__` method. It performs this task by first locating the `__init__` function node within the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the class. If multiple `__init__` functions are found, it raises an assertion error and returns an empty list.

The function then searches for attribute nodes within the identified `__init__` function node. For each attribute node, it checks if the attribute is assigned to `self`, indicating that it is an instance variable. The name of such attributes is extracted using the `get_node_text` method from the `BaseCodeContext` class and added to a list if not already present.

**Note**: This function is particularly useful for developers who need to programmatically analyze Python classes to understand their structure, especially focusing on the data encapsulated within instances of these classes. It can be used in various contexts such as static code analysis tools, documentation generators, or refactoring utilities.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from this function could be `['name', 'age', 'email']`, indicating that the class has three instance variables named `name`, `age`, and `email`.
#### FunctionDef _cb(n)
**_cb**: This function checks if a given node represents an `__init__` method definition and appends it to a list of initialization function nodes.

parameters:
· n: A node object representing a part of the abstract syntax tree (AST) being processed.

Code Description: The function `_cb` takes a single parameter, `n`, which is expected to be a node in an abstract syntax tree. It first checks if the second child of the node (`n.children[1]`) has a type of "identifier" and if its text content matches "__init__". This check is performed using the `type` attribute of the child node and by calling the `get_node_text` method from the `self.context` object, which presumably holds an instance of `BaseCodeContext`. If both conditions are satisfied, indicating that the node represents an `__init__` method definition, the node `n` is appended to a list named `init_func_nodes`.

Note: Usage points. This function appears to be part of a larger code transformation or analysis process where nodes representing `__init__` methods need to be identified and collected for further processing. Developers should ensure that `self.context.get_node_text` correctly retrieves the text content of AST nodes and that `init_func_nodes` is defined in the appropriate scope before this function is called. Beginners should understand that this function operates on an abstract syntax tree, a common data structure used in compilers and interpreters to represent the syntactic structure of source code.
***
#### FunctionDef _cb(n)
**_cb**: This function appends a node to the `attribute_nodes` list.
parameters:
· n: The node to be appended to the `attribute_nodes` list.

Code Description: The function `_cb` is designed to take a single argument, `n`, which represents a node. Inside the function, this node is added to the end of the `attribute_nodes` list using the `append()` method. This suggests that `_cb` is likely used as a callback function in a context where nodes are being processed or collected, such as during parsing or tree traversal operations.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where `_cb` is passed as a callback to functions that iterate over or process nodes, and these nodes need to be stored for further use. Developers should ensure that `attribute_nodes` is defined in the scope where `_cb` is used, typically as a list initialized before any calls to `_cb`. Beginners should understand that modifying lists directly within functions can affect the original list outside the function due to Python's handling of mutable objects.

### FunctionDef class_variable(self)
**class_variable**: This function retrieves class variables from a Python class definition. Class variables are those defined outside of any instance methods and are shared among all instances of the class.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly. It operates on the internal state of the `PythonClass` object it belongs to, specifically using its `node` attribute which represents the parsed syntax tree node for the class definition.

Code Description: 
The function initializes a dictionary named `class_variables` with two keys: "raw" and "processed". The "raw" key holds a list of raw text representations of assignments found in the class body. The "processed" key contains a more detailed list of dictionaries, each representing an assignment with its name, type (if specified), and value.

The function attempts to access the last child node of the `node` attribute, which is expected to be the block containing the class body. If this node does not exist or is not of type "block", a warning is issued using Python's `warnings` module, and the function returns the initialized `class_variables` dictionary.

If the class body node is successfully accessed, the function iterates over its children. For each child that is an expression statement (which can contain assignments), it further examines its children to find nodes of type "assignment". Each assignment node is processed to extract its raw text and details about the variable being assigned, including its name, optional type annotation, and value.

The extracted information is then appended to the appropriate lists in the `class_variables` dictionary. The function finally returns this dictionary containing all identified class variables.

Note: This function assumes that the syntax tree node (`self.node`) has been correctly parsed and represents a valid Python class definition. It also relies on the `context.get_node_text()` method to extract text from nodes, which is expected to return the string representation of the code corresponding to the given node.

Output Example:
A possible output of this function could be:
```python
{
    "raw": ["counter = 0", "name: str = 'default'"],
    "processed": [
        {"name": "counter", "type": "", "value": "0"},
        {"name": "name", "type": "str", "value": "'default'"}
    ]
}
```
This output indicates that the class has two variables, `counter` and `name`, with their respective types and values.
***
### FunctionDef find_all(context)
**find_all**: This function searches through a Python source code's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to identify and return all class definitions present in the code.

parameters:
· context: An instance of PythonCodeContext, which contains the parsed AST (`tree`) and the original source code (`code`).

Code Description: The `find_all` function begins by accessing the root node of the AST from the provided `context`. It initializes an empty list named `classes` to store instances of `PythonClass`, each representing a class definition found in the AST. A nested depth-first search (DFS) function, `dfs`, is defined within `find_all`. This function traverses the AST recursively. If it encounters a node with the type "class_definition", it creates an instance of `PythonClass` using this node and the original context, then appends this instance to the `classes` list. The DFS continues by iterating over each child node of the current node, ensuring all parts of the AST are explored. After the traversal is complete, `find_all` returns the `classes` list containing all identified class definitions.

Note: Usage points include initializing a PythonCodeContext with a parsed AST and source code, then calling `find_all` to retrieve a list of all class definitions in the code for further analysis or transformation.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the function's return value could be a list of PythonClass instances. Each instance represents a class definition found in the source code. For example:

[
    PythonClass(node=<TSNode object representing class 'Foo'>, context=<PythonCodeContext object>),
    PythonClass(node=<TSNode object representing class 'Bar'>, context=<PythonCodeContext object>)
]
#### FunctionDef dfs(node)
**dfs**: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree structure represented by nodes of type `TSNode`. It specifically looks for nodes representing class definitions, creates instances of `PythonClass` for each found, and appends them to a list named `classes`.

**parameters**:
· node: An instance of `TSNode`, which represents a node in the abstract syntax tree (AST) being traversed.

**Code Description**: The function starts by checking if the current node's type is "class_definition". If it is, an instance of `PythonClass` is created using this node and some context information. This new class object is then appended to the `classes` list, which presumably holds all identified classes during the traversal.

Following the check for a class definition, the function iterates over each child node of the current node. For each child, it recursively calls itself (dfs), effectively traversing deeper into the tree structure. This recursive call ensures that every node in the tree is visited, adhering to the depth-first search algorithm's principle of exploring as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where one needs to analyze or extract information from Python source code represented as an abstract syntax tree (AST). The `dfs` function facilitates this by systematically visiting each node and identifying class definitions, which can be crucial for tasks such as static analysis, refactoring tools, or documentation generation. Developers should ensure that the `classes` list is defined in their scope before calling `dfs`, as it accumulates all found classes during the traversal process.
