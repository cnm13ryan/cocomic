## ClassDef PythonASTFileContext
**PythonASTFileContext**: This class extends `BaseFileContext` to provide specific functionality for extracting file-level focal context from Python source files, including imports, function definitions, class definitions, docstrings, and global variables.

attributes:
路 context: An instance of `PythonCodeContext` that provides the coding context necessary for extracting information from the Python file.

Code Description: The `PythonASTFileContext` class is designed to parse and analyze Python source code files by leveraging an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It inherits from `BaseFileContext`, which defines a general structure for parsing source files. However, `PythonASTFileContext` provides concrete implementations for extracting specific elements relevant to Python.

The `file_docstrings` method collects the docstring at the top level of the file, ensuring it is the first valid string node in the AST hierarchy. This method checks each child node of the root node to find a string that represents the module-level docstring.

The `imports` method gathers all import statements from the Python file by collecting nodes of type 'import_statement' and 'import_from'. It uses the `_dfs` method inherited from `BaseFileContext` to traverse the AST and collect these nodes, converting them into code blocks for easier manipulation.

The `parse` method consolidates all extracted information (imports, functions, classes, docstrings, and global variables) into a single dictionary. This method provides a unified interface for accessing various components of the file context, making it easy to retrieve specific parts of the source code programmatically.

The `classes` method extracts class definitions from the Python file by collecting nodes of type 'class_definition'. For each class node found, it further extracts information such as the class signature, name, base classes, docstring, instance variables, and methods. This method ensures that all relevant details about each class are captured in a structured format.

The `functions` method extracts function definitions from the Python file by collecting nodes of type 'function_definition'. For each function node found, it gathers information such as the function signature, name, parameters, return type, decorator, docstring, body, and original string representation. This method ensures that all relevant details about each function are captured in a structured format.

The `global_variables` method identifies global variable assignments by collecting nodes of type 'assignment' at the top level of the AST hierarchy. It checks if the assignment is not within any function or class definition to ensure it captures only global variables.

Note: The `PythonASTFileContext` class is intended for parsing Python source files and provides concrete implementations for extracting imports, functions, classes, docstrings, and global variables from these files.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value when calling `parse()` on an instance could be:
```

}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, context)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of PythonASTFileContext by passing a PythonCodeContext object to its superclass constructor.
parameters:
路 context: An instance of PythonCodeContext representing the specific context for Python code, including parsed AST and source code.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor for the PythonASTFileContext class. It accepts a single parameter, `context`, which must be an instance of the PythonCodeContext class. This method calls the superclass's (presumably BaseASTFileContext) constructor with the provided `context` object. By doing so, it leverages the initialization logic defined in the superclass while ensuring that the Python-specific context is properly set up.

The PythonCodeContext object encapsulates essential information about the Python source code, such as its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and the original source code string. It also provides methods for parsing the code into structured line-token pairs and determining if lines contain actual code. This setup allows PythonASTFileContext to build upon this foundation, potentially adding or extending functionality specific to handling ASTs in a file context.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of PythonASTFileContext by providing a properly initialized PythonCodeContext object. This typically involves parsing the source code into an AST and passing both the AST and the original code string to the PythonCodeContext constructor before using it to initialize a PythonASTFileContext.
***
### FunctionDef file_docstrings(self, node)
**file_docstrings**: This function retrieves the docstring from a Python file's abstract syntax tree (AST). It searches through the top-level nodes of the AST to find the first valid string node that represents a module-level docstring.

**parameters**:
路 node: The root node of the AST representing the entire Python file. This parameter is expected to be an instance of `TSNode`, which is part of the tree-sitter library used for parsing and querying source code.

**Code Description**: The function iterates over the children of the provided AST root node, looking for nodes of type "expression_statement". Within these expression statements, it further searches for child nodes of type "string". Once a string node is found, it uses the `get_node_text` method from the `BaseCodeContext` class to extract the text content of the node. The function then checks if this string is formatted as a docstring (i.e., enclosed in triple quotes, either `"""..."""` or `'''...'''`, with optional raw string prefix `r`). If such a docstring is found, it is returned immediately. If no valid docstring is found after examining all relevant nodes, the function returns an empty string.

**Note**: This function is typically used to extract module-level documentation from Python files, which can be useful for generating documentation or understanding the purpose of the file without reading through its entire content.

**Output Example**: 
If the root node represents a Python file with the following content:
```python
"""
This is an example module.
It demonstrates how docstrings are extracted.
"""

def some_function():
    pass
```
The `file_docstrings` function would return:
```
"This is an example module.\nIt demonstrates how docstrings are extracted.\n"
```
***
### FunctionDef docstrings(self, node)
**docstrings**: Collects the docstring for classes and functions from an abstract syntax tree (AST) node.
parameters:
路 node: The AST node representing a class or function from which to extract the docstring.

Code Description: The `docstrings` method is designed to retrieve the docstring associated with a given class or function represented by an AST node. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach encapsulated in the nested function `dfs_find_docstring`. This helper function traverses the children of the provided node recursively, searching for the first string node encountered, which should be the docstring if it exists.

The method checks if the node type is "string", indicating that it has found a potential docstring. If no children are present, it returns `None`, signifying the end of the search path. Once a string node is identified, the method retrieves its text content using the `get_node_text` function from the context object.

The retrieved string is then validated to ensure it matches common Python docstring formats: triple double quotes (`"""`) or triple single quotes (`'''`), with optional raw string prefixes (`r`). If the string meets these criteria, it is returned as the docstring. Otherwise, an empty string is returned, indicating that no valid docstring was found.

Note: This function assumes that the first string node encountered in a class or function's AST node is indeed its docstring, which aligns with Python's syntax rules where the docstring should be the first statement in the body of a class or function.

Output Example: For a class defined as follows:

```python
class MyClass:
    """This is a sample class."""
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

The `docstrings` method would return `"\"\"\"This is a sample class.\"\"\""` when called with the AST node representing `MyClass`. If no docstring were present, it would return an empty string.
#### FunctionDef dfs_find_docstring(node)
**dfs_find_docstring**: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on an abstract syntax tree (AST) node to find the first string node, which typically represents a docstring in Python source code.

parameters:
路 node: The current AST node being examined. It is expected to have attributes `type` and `children`.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function `dfs_find_docstring` is designed to traverse an abstract syntax tree (AST) starting from the provided node, searching for a string node that represents a docstring. The traversal follows a depth-first search strategy, which means it explores as far down a branch of the tree before backtracking.

1. The function first checks if the current node's type is "string". If true, it returns this node immediately, assuming it contains the desired docstring.
2. If the node does not contain a string and has no children (i.e., `len(node.children) == 0`), the function concludes that there are no further nodes to explore in this branch of the tree and returns None.
3. If the current node is neither a string nor a leaf node, the function proceeds to recursively call itself on the first child of the current node (`node.children[0]`). This recursive call continues until either a string node is found or all branches are exhausted.

Note: Usage points.
This function is particularly useful in tools that analyze Python source code by examining its AST. By finding docstrings, it can help extract documentation comments from the code for further processing or display. The function assumes that the input node and its children have the attributes `type` and `children`, which are typical of nodes in an AST representation.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If the function finds a string node, it returns this node object. For example:
```
node = {
    "type": "string",
    "value": '"""This is a docstring."""',
    "children": []
}
```
In this case, `dfs_find_docstring(node)` would return the `node` itself.

If no string nodes are found in the subtree rooted at the given node, the function returns None.
***
***
### FunctionDef imports(self)
**imports**: Collects all import statements from a Python file by analyzing its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

parameters:
路 None: This function does not take any parameters.

Code Description: The `imports` method is designed to gather all import-related statements present in a Python source file. It achieves this by leveraging the AST of the file, which represents the syntactic structure of the code in a tree format. 

The process begins with calling the `collect_nodes` method, passing it a list containing the strings "import_statement" and "import_from_statement". These strings specify the types of nodes to be collected from the AST. The `collect_nodes` function performs a depth-first search through the AST, identifying all nodes that match these specified types. It returns a list of these nodes.

Next, for each node in this list, the `get_code_block` method is invoked. This method converts each node into a `CodeBlock` object, which encapsulates the block of text corresponding to the import statement along with its line numbers within the file. The text attribute of each `CodeBlock` object contains the actual code as it appears in the source file.

Finally, the method constructs a dictionary where the key is "imports" and the value is a list of strings. Each string in this list represents an import statement from the file, extracted and formatted by the previous steps. This dictionary is then returned by the `imports` method.

Note: The `imports` function is typically called as part of parsing a Python file to gather various contextual information about its contents. It is used in conjunction with other methods like `functions`, `classes`, and `global_variables` to provide a comprehensive overview of the file's structure and components.

Output Example: If a Python file contains the following import statements:
```
import system
from sys import a
from system import utils as s
```

The function would return a dictionary structured as follows:
{"imports": ["import system", "from sys import a", "from system import utils as s"]}
***
### FunctionDef global_variables(self)
**global_variables**: This function collects global variables defined within a Python file by parsing its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It assumes that global variable names do not duplicate.

parameters:
路 None: The function does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the internal state of the `PythonASTFileContext` instance, specifically the AST tree and code bytes.

Code Description: The function initializes an empty list named `global_vars`. It then iterates over the children of the root node in the AST. For each child that is an expression statement, it further examines its children to find assignments. An assignment is considered valid if it has exactly three children (indicating a simple variable assignment). The function extracts the text content of the variable name and value using the `get_node_text` method from the `BaseCodeContext`. Each global variable is stored as a list containing the variable name and its assigned value, which is then appended to the `global_vars` list. Finally, the function returns a dictionary with a single key `"global_vars"` whose value is the list of collected global variables.

Note: This function assumes that all global variables are defined at the top level of the file within expression statements and not inside functions or classes. It does not handle more complex assignment scenarios such as multiple assignments in one line or assignments involving expressions.

Output Example: 
{
    "global_vars": [
        ["MAX_VALUE", "100"],
        ["DEFAULT_COLOR", "'blue'"]
    ]
}

#### FunctionDef find_functions(node)
**find_functions**: This function traverses a given abstract syntax tree (AST) node to identify and collect all function definition nodes within it, including those that may be nested under other nodes such as decorators.

parameters:
路 node: The AST node from which to start searching for function definitions. This is expected to be an object with a 'children' attribute containing further nodes of the AST.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function initializes an empty list named `func_nodes` to store function definition nodes found during traversal. It then iterates over each child node of the provided `node`. If a child node has a type attribute equal to "function_definition", it is appended directly to the `func_nodes` list. For cases where functions might be decorated (and thus nested under another node), the function performs an additional level of checking by iterating through the children of each child node. If any of these sub-children have a type attribute equal to "function_definition", they are also added to the `func_nodes` list. After all possible nodes have been checked, the function returns the `func_nodes` list containing all identified function definition nodes.

Note: Usage points.
This function is particularly useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze or manipulate Python code programmatically by examining its structure at a granular level. It can be used in tools for static analysis, refactoring, or any other application that requires understanding the functions defined within a piece of code.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming an AST node representing a Python module with two function definitions (one directly under the module and another nested under a decorator), the output might look like this:

[
    <ASTNode object at 0x7f8b4c3a2d50>,  # Represents the first function definition
    <ASTNode object at 0x7f8b4c3a2e90>   # Represents the second function definition, nested under a decorator
]

Each `<ASTNode object>` in this list would have attributes and methods corresponding to its role as a function definition node within the AST.
***
#### FunctionDef extract_use(assignments, ids)
**extract_use**: This function identifies and extracts variable usage relationships from a list of assignments based on specified identifiers.

**parameters**:
路 assignments: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents an assignment operation with two elements - the left-hand side (variable being assigned to) and the right-hand side (expression or value being assigned).
路 ids: A list of identifiers (variables) that are of interest for tracking their usage in the given assignments.

**Code Description**: The function initializes an empty dictionary named `uses` to store the relationships between variables. It iterates over each assignment in the `assignments` list, splitting it into `left` and `right` components representing the left-hand side and right-hand side of the assignment, respectively. For each assignment, it checks if the `left` variable is present in the `ids` list. If not, the function skips to the next assignment.

If the `left` variable exists in `ids`, the function then searches for other identifiers from `ids` that are used within the `right` side of the assignment (excluding the `left` variable itself and special identifiers like "self" and "*"). For each such identifier found, it records this usage by adding the identifier to a list associated with the `left` variable in the `uses` dictionary. If no entry for the `left` variable exists yet in the `uses` dictionary, it creates one.

The function finally returns the `uses` dictionary, which contains mappings of each relevant `left` variable to a list of other variables used within its assignment expression.

**Note**: This function is particularly useful in scenarios where understanding how certain variables are utilized in assignments can provide insights into data flow and dependencies within code. It helps in static analysis tasks such as refactoring or optimization by identifying which variables influence others.

**Output Example**: Given the following input:
- assignments = [('x', 'y + z'), ('a', 'b * c'), ('m', 'n - o')]
- ids = ['x', 'y', 'z', 'a', 'b', 'c']

The function might return:
{'x': ['y', 'z'], 'a': ['b', 'c']}

This output indicates that in the assignments provided, variable `x` uses variables `y` and `z`, while variable `a` uses variables `b` and `c`. Variables `m`, `n`, and `o` are not included in the output because they were not specified in the `ids` list.
