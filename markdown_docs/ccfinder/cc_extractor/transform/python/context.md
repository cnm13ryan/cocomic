## ClassDef PythonCodeContext
**PythonCodeContext**: This class represents a specific context for Python code, extending from the BaseCodeContext. It is designed to handle parsing and tokenizing Python source code into structured line-token pairs, while also providing methods to determine if lines contain actual code.

attributes:
· tree: A parsed Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) represented by a TSTree object.
· code: The original source code as a string.

Code Description: PythonCodeContext is an extension of BaseCodeContext specifically tailored for Python. It initializes with a parsed AST and the corresponding source code, setting the language to "python". If there are no syntax errors in the code and the maximum line length does not exceed a predefined limit (PY_MAX_LINE_LENGTH), it proceeds to parse the code into structured line-token pairs using the _parse method inherited from BaseCodeContext. The class includes methods for assigning tokens to specific lines of code and determining whether a given line contains actual code.

The assign_token_to_line method recursively traverses the AST, assigning each token to its corresponding line in the source code. It handles both leaf nodes (which represent individual tokens) and non-leaf nodes (such as strings that span multiple lines). The is_code_line method checks if a specific line of code contains actual Python code by examining the types of tokens present on that line.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of PythonCodeContext with a parsed AST and source code; parsing the code into structured line-token pairs using _parse; iterating over tokens or lines for analysis or transformation; validating token integrity; checking for syntax errors in the code; and extracting specific parts of the code based on node types or line numbers.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the `parsed_lines` attribute after calling `_parse` could be a list of CodeLineTokens objects, each representing a line of code along with its tokens. For instance:

[
    CodeLineTokens(line_no=0, tokens=[Token(node=<TSNode object>, code_bytes=b'def foo():')], text='def foo():'),
    CodeLineTokens(line_no=1, tokens=[Token(node=<TSNode object>, code_bytes=b'    return 42'), Token(node=<TSNode object>, code_bytes=b'\n')], text='    return 42\n')
]
### FunctionDef __init__(self, tree, code)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the PythonCodeContext class by setting up necessary attributes and parsing the source code if there are no syntax errors and the line length is within acceptable limits.

parameters:
· tree: A TSTree object representing the syntax tree of the source code.
· code: A string containing the raw source code to be analyzed.

**Code Description**: The constructor first calls the superclass's (BaseCodeContext) initializer, passing the syntax tree (`tree`), the source code (`code`), and a language identifier ("python"). This setup is essential for initializing common attributes required by all code contexts.

Next, it checks if the maximum line length of the provided code does not exceed `PY_MAX_LINE_LENGTH`. This check ensures that the code adheres to a reasonable line length limit, which can be important for readability and certain parsing operations. If this condition is satisfied, the constructor proceeds to check for syntax errors in the code by evaluating the `syntax_error` attribute.

If no syntax error is detected (`self.syntax_error` is False), the constructor calls the `_parse` method to parse the source code into a structured format. The parsed lines are stored in the `parsed_lines` attribute, which can be used for further analysis or transformations. If a syntax error is present, an informational log message is generated using the logger, indicating that a syntax error was detected in the provided code snippet.

**Note**: This constructor is crucial for setting up the PythonCodeContext instance with all necessary data and ensuring that the source code meets basic criteria (line length and absence of syntax errors) before proceeding with more complex parsing operations. It leverages methods from the superclass to perform these checks and initializations, maintaining a clean and modular design.

### FunctionDef assign_token_to_line(self, node, line_tokens)
**assign_token_to_line**: This function assigns a given tree-sitter node to its corresponding line(s) within a dictionary mapping lines to tokens.

parameters:
· node: A TSNode object representing a node in the syntax tree.
· line_tokens: A dictionary where keys are line numbers and values are lists of nodes that belong to those lines.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if the provided node is either a leaf node or specifically a string node. In tree-sitter's Python parser, string nodes can sometimes contain multiple child tokens (like parentheses) but do not represent the content of the string itself as a single token. If the node spans across different lines, it must be a multi-line string comment, and an assertion checks this condition. The function then iterates over each line number that the node covers, appending the node to the list of tokens for each respective line in the `line_tokens` dictionary.

If the node does not span multiple lines, it is added directly to the list corresponding to its start (and end) line number. For non-leaf nodes, the function recursively calls itself on each child node, ensuring that all parts of the syntax tree are processed and assigned to their respective lines in the `line_tokens` dictionary.

Note: This function is crucial for organizing tokens into a format that can be easily analyzed or manipulated based on their line positions within the source code. It assumes that the input `node` is part of a valid syntax tree generated by tree-sitter's Python parser and that `line_tokens` is properly initialized with keys corresponding to all lines in the source file.

### FunctionDef is_code_line(self, line_no)
**is_code_line**: This function determines whether a given line number corresponds to a line of actual code within a parsed Python file, excluding lines that are either empty, comments, or contain only string literals.

parameters:
· line_no: An integer representing the line number in the source code for which the check is being performed. Line numbers start from 0.

Code Description: The function starts by retrieving the line object corresponding to the provided line number from a list of parsed lines stored in `self.parsed_lines`. It then extracts the tokens associated with that line. If there are no tokens, it concludes that the line is empty and returns False. If there is exactly one token, it checks whether this token is either a string or a comment. In such cases, the function also returns False, as these do not represent lines of executable code. For all other scenarios, where the line contains more than one token or a single non-string, non-comment token, the function returns True, indicating that the line is part of the actual code.

Note: This function assumes that the source code has been parsed and stored in `self.parsed_lines` with each line object containing its respective tokens. The tokens themselves are expected to have a `node.type` attribute that can be checked against specific types like "string" or "comment".

Output Example: If the input `line_no` corresponds to a line that contains an import statement, function definition, variable assignment, etc., the function will return True. For example, if line 5 of the source code is `x = 10`, then `is_code_line(5)` would return True. Conversely, if line 3 is just a comment like `# This is a comment`, then `is_code_line(3)` would return False. Similarly, an empty line or a line with only a string literal would also result in False being returned.
