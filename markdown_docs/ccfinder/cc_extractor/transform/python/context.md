# Class Documentation: `Calculator`

## Overview

The `Calculator` class is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This class provides methods that take two numeric inputs and return the result of the operation.

## Class Definition

```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        """Return the sum of a and b."""
        pass
    
    def subtract(self, a, b):
        """Return the difference of a and b."""
        pass
    
    def multiply(self, a, b):
        """Return the product of a and b."""
        pass
    
    def divide(self, a, b):
        """Return the quotient of a divided by b. Raises ValueError if b is zero."""
        pass
```

## Methods

### `add(a, b)`

- **Purpose**: Computes the sum of two numbers.
- **Parameters**:
  - `a`: The first number (int or float).
  - `b`: The second number (int or float).
- **Returns**: The sum of `a` and `b` as a float.

### `subtract(a, b)`

- **Purpose**: Computes the difference between two numbers.
- **Parameters**:
  - `a`: The first number (int or float).
  - `b`: The second number (int or float).
- **Returns**: The result of subtracting `b` from `a` as a float.

### `multiply(a, b)`

- **Purpose**: Computes the product of two numbers.
- **Parameters**:
  - `a`: The first number (int or float).
  - `b`: The second number (int or float).
- **Returns**: The product of `a` and `b` as a float.

### `divide(a, b)`

- **Purpose**: Computes the quotient of two numbers.
- **Parameters**:
  - `a`: The dividend (int or float).
  - `b`: The divisor (int or float).
- **Returns**: The result of dividing `a` by `b` as a float.
- **Exceptions**:
  - Raises a `ValueError` if `b` is zero, to prevent division by zero.

## Usage Example

```python
calc = Calculator()
result_add = calc.add(10, 5)       # result_add will be 15.0
result_subtract = calc.subtract(10, 5)  # result_subtract will be 5.0
result_multiply = calc.multiply(10, 5)  # result_multiply will be 50.0
result_divide = calc.divide(10, 5)    # result_divide will be 2.0
```

### FunctionDef assign_token_to_line(self, node, line_tokens)
**Function Overview**: The `assign_token_to_line` function is responsible for assigning a given tree-sitter node to its corresponding line(s) within a dictionary that maps lines to tokens.

**Parameters**:
- **node (TSNode)**: Represents the current node in the abstract syntax tree (AST). This parameter is essential as it provides the structure and type information of the code segment being processed.
- **line_tokens (Dict[int, List])**: A dictionary where keys are line numbers and values are lists of nodes that belong to those lines. This parameter is used to accumulate tokens for each line in the source code.

**Return Values**: The function does not return any value explicitly. Instead, it modifies the `line_tokens` dictionary in place by appending nodes to the appropriate line entries.

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `assign_token_to_line` function operates recursively on the AST nodes provided by tree-sitter. It checks if a node is a leaf or a string node (which can span multiple lines). If the node spans multiple lines, it asserts that the node must be of type "string" and then appends the node to each line in its range. For single-line nodes, it simply appends the node to the corresponding line's list.

The function handles recursion by iterating over the children of a non-leaf node and calling itself for each child, thus ensuring that all nodes are processed regardless of their depth in the AST.

**Relationship Description**: Based on the provided structure and code, there is no explicit indication of `referencer_content` or `reference_letter`. Therefore, it can be inferred that the documentation focuses solely on the function's internal logic and its role within the project without detailing external relationships with other components.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that string nodes are not leaf nodes but contain sub-tokens like parentheses. This assumption is critical for handling multi-line strings correctly.
- **Limitations**: The function directly modifies the `line_tokens` dictionary, which can lead to side effects if not handled carefully. It might be beneficial to ensure that this behavior is well-documented and understood by users of the function.
- **Refactoring Suggestions**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: For complex expressions such as `node.start_point[0]`, introducing a variable like `start_line_no` improves readability.
  - **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: The conditional structure can be slightly simplified using guard clauses to handle the leaf node and string node cases separately at the beginning of the function. This would make the main logic easier to follow.
  
Example refactoring with guard clauses:
```python
def assign_token_to_line(self, node: TSNode, line_tokens: Dict[int, List]):
    if len(node.children) == 0 or node.type == "string":
        start_line_no = node.start_point[0]
        end_line_no = node.end_point[0]

        if start_line_no != end_line_no:
            assert node.type == "string", f"Node type has to be string to cross line, got {node.type} instead"
            for l1 in range(start_line_no, end_line_no + 1):
                line_tokens[l1].append(node)
            return

        # the tokens should come in order
        line_tokens[start_line_no].append(node)
        return

    for c in node.children:
        self.assign_token_to_line(c, line_tokens)
```
This refactoring uses guard clauses to handle the base cases early, making the main logic more readable and reducing nesting.

### FunctionDef is_code_line(self, line_no)
**Function Overview**: The `is_code_line` function determines whether a specified line number contains executable Python code.

**Parameters**:
- **line_no**: An integer representing the line number of the source code to be evaluated. This parameter indicates which line in the parsed lines should be checked for being a code line.

**Return Values**:
- Returns `True` if the specified line contains executable code.
- Returns `False` if the specified line is empty or consists solely of a string or comment.

**Detailed Explanation**:
The function `is_code_line` checks whether a given line number in the parsed source code represents an actual line of code. It does this by examining the tokens on that line:
1. **Empty Line Check**: If there are no tokens, it is considered an empty line and returns `False`.
2. **Single Token Check**: If there is only one token, it checks if that token is a string or comment. If so, it returns `False` because strings and comments alone do not constitute executable code.
3. **Executable Code Line**: If the line has more than one token or contains a single token that is neither a string nor a comment, it is considered an executable code line, and the function returns `True`.

**Relationship Description**:
- There are no references provided in the given context for either callers (`referencer_content`) or callees (`reference_letter`). Therefore, there is no functional relationship to describe with other components within the project.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle cases where a line might contain only whitespace characters. It treats such lines as empty lines, which may be acceptable but should be confirmed based on requirements.
- **Refactoring Opportunities**:
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: For the condition checking if the single token is either a string or comment, an explaining variable can improve readability. For example:
    ```python
    def is_code_line(self, line_no) -> bool:
        code_line = self.parsed_lines[line_no]
        tokens = code_line.tokens
        if len(tokens) == 0:
            return False
        if len(tokens) == 1:
            single_token_type = tokens[0].node.type
            if single_token_type == "string" or single_token_type == "comment":
                return False
        return True
    ```
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: The condition `if single_token_type == "string" or single_token_type == "comment"` can be simplified using the `in` operator:
  ```python
  if single_token_type in ("string", "comment"):
      return False
  ```

By applying these refactoring techniques, the function becomes more readable and maintainable.
