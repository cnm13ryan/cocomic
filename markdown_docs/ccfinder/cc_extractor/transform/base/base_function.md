## ClassDef BaseFunction
**BaseFunction**: Base class representing a function within a source code file. It encapsulates common properties and behaviors shared across different programming languages, such as Python.

attributes:
· node: Represents the Tree-sitter node corresponding to the function definition.
· context: An instance of BaseCodeContext that provides access to the broader code structure and utilities.

**Code Description**: The `BaseFunction` class serves as an abstract base for functions in various programming languages. It initializes with a Tree-sitter node (`node`) and a context object (`context`). The class defines several properties that provide information about the function, such as its start and end line numbers, name, body, block, number of preceding characters, whether it is empty, the number of lines in its body, type, and text representation. 

The `start_line_no` and `end_line_no` properties return the starting and ending line numbers of the function definition within the source file. The `name` property should be overridden by subclasses to provide the function's name as a string or None if it is anonymous.

The `body` property represents the actual body of the function, excluding any documentation comments. Similarly, the `block` property returns the node that contains all statements in the function's body. Both these properties are intended to be implemented by subclasses.

The `num_preceding_chars` property calculates the number of characters before the function definition in the source file. It iterates through each line up to the start line of the function and sums their lengths.

The `empty` property checks if the function's body is empty by verifying whether the block node is None.

The `num_body_lines` property returns the number of lines in the function's body.

The `func_type` property provides the type of the function as defined in the Tree-sitter grammar, which can be useful for distinguishing between different kinds of functions (e.g., regular functions, async functions).

The `text` property retrieves the full text representation of the function from the context using the node.

The class includes two static methods and one instance method that are intended to be overridden by subclasses. The `find_all` static method is designed to retrieve all internal functions within a given context. The `search_function_call` instance method checks whether another function or callable is called within the current function's body. Lastly, the `get_docstring` method should return the docstring node if present, otherwise None.

**Note**: This class is intended to be subclassed for specific programming languages, such as Python, where additional properties and methods can be implemented to provide language-specific functionality.

**Output Example**: An instance of a subclass like `PythonFunction` might have the following attributes:
- start_line_no: 10
- end_line_no: 25
- name: "calculate_total"
- body: ["result = x + y", "return result"]
- block: <TSNode type="block">
- num_preceding_chars: 345
- empty: False
- num_body_lines: 2
- func_type: "function_definition"
- text: "def calculate_total(x, y):\n    result = x + y\n    return result"
### FunctionDef __init__(self, node, context)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of BaseFunction by setting up its node and context attributes.
parameters:
· node: Represents a specific node within a parsed Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This node is crucial for understanding the structure and elements of the code being analyzed or transformed.
· context: An object of type BaseCodeContext that holds various parsed structures of the code, including the AST itself, the original source code, language information, and more. It serves as a repository for all necessary data related to the code.

Code Description: The __init__ method is responsible for initializing an instance of the BaseFunction class with two key components: a node from the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and a context object that encapsulates parsed structures of the code. This setup allows the BaseFunction to operate on specific parts of the code (as indicated by the node) while having access to comprehensive information about the entire codebase through the context.

The method takes two parameters:
1. `node`: This parameter is expected to be an instance of TSNode, which represents a particular node in the AST. The node could correspond to any element within the source code, such as a function definition, variable declaration, or control structure.
2. `context`: This parameter should be an instance of BaseCodeContext. It provides a rich set of attributes and methods that facilitate various operations on the parsed code, including validation, token assignment, parsing into structured formats, iteration over tokens or lines, syntax error checking, and more.

By initializing these two components, the BaseFunction is equipped to perform transformations or analyses that are both context-aware (through the context object) and focused on specific elements of the code (via the node).

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of BaseFunction with a particular node from the AST and a fully populated BaseCodeContext object. This setup enables developers to work with specific parts of the code while having access to all necessary parsed data, making it easier to implement complex transformations or analyses.
***
### FunctionDef start_line_no(self)
**start_line_no**: This function retrieves the starting line number of a node within its context.
parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `start_line_no` method is designed to return the line number where a specific node begins. It accesses the `start_point` attribute of the `node` object, which contains a tuple with two elements representing the starting row and column of the node in its source code. The function returns only the first element of this tuple, which corresponds to the starting line number.

Note: This method is utilized by other functions within the same class or module to determine positional information about nodes relative to each other or within the file. For example, `num_preceding_chars` uses `start_line_no` to calculate how many characters appear before a given function definition in the source code.

Output Example: If the node starts at line 10 of its source file, calling `start_line_no` would return `10`.
***
### FunctionDef end_line_no(self)
**end_line_no**: This function retrieves the line number where a specific node ends within a source code file.
parameters:
· No parameters: The function does not accept any input arguments.
Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `end_line_no` function is designed to return the ending line number of a particular node in a parsed source code structure. This node could represent various elements such as functions, classes, or statements within the codebase. The function accesses an attribute named `end_point` from the `node` object, which contains a tuple with two values: the first value (index 0) is the line number where the node ends, and the second value (index 1) would typically represent the column number at the end of the node. However, in this specific function implementation, only the line number (first element of the `end_point` tuple) is returned.

Note: Usage points.
This function is particularly useful for developers who need to perform operations or analyses that require knowledge of where a code construct ends within its file. For example, it can be used in static analysis tools, refactoring utilities, or any application that needs to understand the physical layout of source code elements.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If the node in question ends on line 42 of the source file, calling `end_line_no` would return:
42
***
### FunctionDef name(self)
**name**: This function is intended to return the name of a function as a string. If the function does not have a name, it returns None, indicating that the function is anonymous.

**parameters**:
· No parameters: The function does not accept any input parameters.

**Code Description**: The `name` method is defined within a class (likely part of a larger framework or library for handling functions). It is designed to provide the name of an instance representing a function. However, it currently raises a `NotImplementedError`, suggesting that this functionality has not yet been implemented in the current version of the codebase. This means that calling this method will result in an error until the actual implementation is provided.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where you might want to retrieve the name of a function for debugging, logging, or documentation purposes. Since the method currently raises an error, developers should be aware that they cannot use it as intended until the functionality is implemented. It is advisable to check the project's roadmap or issue tracker for updates on when this feature might be available.
***
### FunctionDef body(self)
**body**: This method is intended to return the actual body of a function as a list of strings, excluding any documentation comments.

parameters:
· None: The method does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `body` method is defined within a class that likely represents a function or a similar code construct. This method is designed to provide the core content of the function body without including any documentation strings (docstrings) that might be present in the original function definition. The return type annotation indicates that this method should return a list of strings, where each string typically represents a line of code within the function's body.

The current implementation of the `body` method raises a `NotImplementedError`, suggesting that it is an abstract method or a placeholder intended to be overridden by subclasses. This design pattern is common in base classes where specific behavior needs to be defined by derived classes, ensuring that all subclasses provide their own implementations for this method.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should implement the `body` method in any subclass of `BaseFunction` to return the actual lines of code that make up the function body. This is crucial for any functionality that relies on analyzing or transforming the core logic of functions, such as static analysis tools, refactoring utilities, or documentation generators. The absence of a concrete implementation in the base class emphasizes the importance of this method in subclasses and indicates that it plays a central role in the overall functionality of the system. Beginners should be aware that they need to provide their own logic for extracting and returning the function body when subclassing `BaseFunction`.
***
### FunctionDef block(self)
**block**: This function is intended to return a node representing the block of code that contains all body statements within a function. However, it currently raises a NotImplemented error, indicating that its implementation is pending.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `block` method is part of a class likely related to parsing or transforming code structures, possibly in the context of an abstract syntax tree (AST). Its purpose is to provide access to the block node that encapsulates all statements within the body of a function. This could be useful for various transformations or analyses that require understanding or modifying the contents of a function's body.

The current implementation of `block` simply raises a NotImplemented error, suggesting that while its role is defined, the actual functionality to retrieve and return the block node has not yet been implemented. This might be due to the method being in an abstract base class where subclasses are expected to provide their own implementations tailored to specific parsing or transformation needs.

Note: Usage points.
This function is referenced by other methods within the same class or hierarchy, such as `empty`. The `empty` method checks whether the function body is empty by verifying if the result of `block` is None. Since `block` currently raises an error instead of returning a node or None, calling `empty` would also lead to an error unless `block` is properly implemented to return either a valid node or None when the block is indeed empty. Developers working with this code should be aware of this limitation and ensure that `block` is correctly implemented before relying on methods like `empty`.
***
### FunctionDef num_preceding_chars(self)
**num_preceding_chars**: This function calculates the total number of characters that appear before the start of a specific function definition within its source file.
parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `num_preceding_chars` method is designed to determine how many characters precede the starting line of a given function definition. It initializes a counter, `num_preceding_chars`, to zero. Then, it iterates over each line in the source code using the `lines` method from the `BaseCodeContext` class. For each line, if the line number is less than the starting line number of the function (obtained via the `start_line_no` method), it adds the length of that line to the counter. This process continues until all lines preceding the function definition have been counted. Finally, the method returns the total count of characters.

Note: This method is useful for determining the position of a function within its source file in terms of character count, which can be important for various transformations or analyses involving code structure and positioning.

Output Example: If a function starts at line 5, and lines 1 through 4 contain 20, 30, 15, and 25 characters respectively, calling `num_preceding_chars` would return `90`, as the total number of characters in lines 1 to 4 is 90.
***
### FunctionDef empty(self)
**empty**: This function checks whether the body of a function is empty by evaluating if the `block` attribute is None.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `empty` method is part of a class designed to handle and analyze code structures, possibly within an abstract syntax tree (AST). Its primary role is to determine whether the body of a function contains any statements or if it is empty. This is achieved by checking if the `block` attribute of the instance is None. The `block` attribute is expected to represent the node containing all body statements of the function.

The method returns True if the `block` is None, indicating that there are no statements in the function's body, and False otherwise. However, it is important to note that the current implementation of the `block` method raises a NotImplemented error, which means calling `empty` will also result in an error unless the `block` method is properly implemented to return either a valid node or None when appropriate.

Note: Usage points. The `empty` function is typically used in scenarios where it is necessary to verify if a function's body contains any code before performing further operations, such as transformations or analyses. Developers should ensure that the `block` method is correctly implemented to avoid runtime errors and to obtain accurate results from the `empty` method.

Output Example: If the `block` attribute of an instance is set to None, calling `empty()` on that instance would return True, indicating that the function body is empty. Conversely, if `block` contains a valid node representing the function's body statements, `empty()` would return False.
***
### FunctionDef num_body_lines(self)
**num_body_lines**: This function returns the number of lines in the body of a function, excluding any documentation comments.

parameters:
· None: The method does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `num_body_lines` function is part of a class that represents a function or similar code construct. It calculates and returns the count of lines within the function's body by utilizing another method named `body`. The `body` method is expected to return the core content of the function as a list of strings, excluding any documentation comments (docstrings). By obtaining this list from the `body` method, `num_body_lines` simply computes its length using Python's built-in `len()` function and returns this value.

The implementation assumes that the `body` method is properly defined in the class or its subclasses to provide a valid list of lines representing the function body. This design allows for flexibility, as different types of functions can have their bodies extracted differently by overriding the `body` method in subclasses.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should ensure that the `body` method returns an accurate representation of the function's core content without including documentation comments to use this function effectively. Beginners are advised to understand how the `body` method works and is implemented in their specific subclass of `BaseFunction`. This ensures that `num_body_lines` provides correct line counts, which can be crucial for various analyses or transformations involving the function body.

Output Example: If the `body` method returns a list like `['def example():', '    return 42']`, then calling `num_body_lines` would output `2`.
***
### FunctionDef func_type(self)
**func_type**: This function returns the type of the function represented by the current object instance.

parameters:
· No parameters: The function does not accept any input arguments.

Code Description: The `func_type` method is a part of a class, likely within a module designed to handle or analyze functions in some form. When called on an instance of this class, it accesses the `node` attribute of that instance and retrieves its `type`. This implies that the `node` object has a `type` attribute which holds information about the type or kind of function being represented.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where one needs to determine the nature or category of a function programmatically. For example, in an abstract syntax tree (AST) traversal context, this method could be used to differentiate between various types of functions such as built-in, user-defined, lambda, etc.

Output Example: Assuming the `node.type` attribute holds a string indicating the type of function, a possible return value could be 'user_defined' or 'builtin'. For instance, if the function being represented is a standard Python function defined by the user, calling this method might return 'user_defined'.
***
### FunctionDef text(self)
**text**: This function retrieves the text content of a specified node from the current context.
parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly but relies on instance attributes `self.context` and `self.node`.
Code Description: The `text` method is designed to extract and return the textual content associated with a specific node within a code structure. It leverages an internal method, `get_node_text`, from the `BaseCodeContext` class. This helper function requires a node object as input and returns the text content of that node by slicing the byte array (`code_bytes`) based on the start and end bytes of the node. The sliced bytes are then decoded into a UTF-8 string to provide human-readable text.
Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to access or manipulate the textual representation of nodes, such as during code analysis, transformation, or extraction tasks.
Output Example: If `self.node` represents a node containing the code snippet "print('Hello, World!')", calling `text()` would return the string "print('Hello, World!')" as output.
***
### FunctionDef find_all(context)
**find_all**: This function is designed to retrieve all internal functions from a given context. The context is expected to be an instance of `BaseCodeContext`, which encapsulates various parsed structures of the code such as its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), the original source code, and metadata about the language.

parameters:
· context: An object of type `BaseCodeContext` that holds parsed code structures including lines of code, tokens stream, and more.

Code Description: The function `find_all` is intended to process a provided `BaseCodeContext` object to identify and return all internal functions contained within it. However, the current implementation raises a `NotImplemented` error, indicating that this functionality has not yet been fully developed or defined in the codebase. This suggests that while the function's purpose is clear, its actual behavior and how it extracts functions from the context remains undefined.

The function takes one parameter, `context`, which should be an instance of `BaseCodeContext`. The `BaseCodeContext` class provides a structured way to access parsed elements of the code, such as its AST (`tree`), the original source code (`code`), and other metadata like the programming language (`lang`). It also includes methods for parsing the code into line-token pairs, iterating over tokens or lines, validating token integrity, checking for syntax errors, and extracting specific parts of the code based on node types or line numbers.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of `BaseCodeContext` with a parsed AST, source code, and language identifier; parsing the code into structured line-token pairs using `_parse`; iterating over tokens or lines for analysis or transformation; validating token integrity; checking for syntax errors in the code; and extracting specific parts of the code based on node types or line numbers. However, developers should be aware that `find_all` currently does not perform any operations and will raise an error if called as is. Implementing this function would involve defining how to traverse the AST or use other parsed data within `BaseCodeContext` to identify and return all internal functions.
***
### FunctionDef search_function_call(self, call_id)
**search_function_call**: This function is designed to determine whether a specific function or callable is invoked within the body of another function. It takes a string identifier for the function/callable being searched for and returns a boolean indicating the presence of such a call.

parameters:
· call_id: A string representing the unique identifier (name) of the function or callable that needs to be searched for within the current function's body.

Code Description: The function `search_function_call` is intended to perform a search operation to check if a particular function or callable, identified by `call_id`, is called anywhere within the function where this method is invoked. However, as of the provided code snippet, the functionality has not been implemented yet, and it raises a `NotImplementedError`. This suggests that while the interface for searching function calls is defined, the actual logic to perform this search is pending.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to analyze or refactor code to understand dependencies between functions. Once implemented, this method could be used in tools for static code analysis, refactoring utilities, or automated testing frameworks to verify that certain functions are being called as expected. Developers should be aware that the current implementation does not provide any functionality and will raise an error if invoked.
***
### FunctionDef get_docstring(self)
**get_docstring**: This function is intended to check whether a docstring is present for a given function. It returns an Optional[TSNode] which suggests it may return either a TSNode object if a docstring exists or None if it does not.

parameters:
· **kwargs: This parameter allows the function to accept any number of keyword arguments, providing flexibility in how the function can be called with additional data that might be necessary for its operation. However, based on the current implementation, these parameters are not utilized as the function raises a NotImplemented error.

Code Description: The function is currently incomplete and does not perform any operations related to checking for docstrings or returning TSNode objects. Instead, it immediately raises a NotImplemented error, indicating that this functionality has yet to be implemented. This suggests that while the function's purpose is defined in its docstring comment, the actual implementation details are pending.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where one might want to check if a specific function within a codebase has an associated docstring for documentation purposes. However, due to the current state of the function raising NotImplemented, it cannot be used as intended until the functionality is properly implemented. Developers should avoid calling this function in its current form and look for alternative methods or implementations that can fulfill the task of checking for docstrings.
