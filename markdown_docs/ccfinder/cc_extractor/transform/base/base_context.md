## ClassDef BaseCodeContext
**BaseCodeContext**: Object to hold various parsed code structures such as lines of code, tokens stream, and more.

attributes:
· tree: A parsed Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) represented by a TSTree object.
· code: The original source code as a string.
· lang: The programming language of the code as a string.
· code_bytes: The byte representation of the original source code for validation purposes.
· parsed_lines: A list that will be populated with CodeLineTokens objects representing lines of code and their associated tokens.

Code Description: BaseCodeContext is designed to encapsulate the structure of parsed code, including its AST, the raw code itself, and metadata about the language. It provides methods for validating token integrity, assigning tokens to specific lines, parsing the entire code into a structured format, iterating over tokens, retrieving specific lines or line ranges, checking for syntax errors, determining the maximum line length, finding the line number of a given token, extracting node text, collecting nodes by type, and more. The class is intended to be extended with language-specific implementations, as indicated by the NotImplemented methods `assign_token_to_line` and `is_code_line`.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of BaseCodeContext with a parsed AST, source code, and language identifier; parsing the code into structured line-token pairs using `_parse`; iterating over tokens or lines for analysis or transformation; validating token integrity; checking for syntax errors in the code; and extracting specific parts of the code based on node types or line numbers.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the `parsed_lines` attribute after calling `_parse` could be a list of CodeLineTokens objects, each representing a line of code along with its tokens. For instance:

[
    CodeLineTokens(line_no=0, tokens=[Token(node=<TSNode object>, code_bytes=b'def foo():')], text='def foo():'),
    CodeLineTokens(line_no=1, tokens=[Token(node=<TSNode object>, code_bytes=b'    return 42')], text='    return 42')
]
### FunctionDef __init__(self, tree, code, lang)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of BaseCodeContext, setting up essential attributes necessary for processing source code.

parameters:
· tree: A TSTree object representing the parsed Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the source code.
· code: A string containing the raw source code.
· lang: A string indicating the programming language of the source code.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor that initializes several key attributes for an instance of BaseCodeContext. It takes three parameters: tree, code, and lang. The 'tree' parameter is expected to be a TSTree object which represents the parsed AST of the provided source code. This AST can be used for various analyses such as syntax checking, refactoring, or static analysis.

The 'code' parameter is a string that holds the raw source code. This attribute will be stored directly in the instance and also converted to bytes using UTF-8 encoding, which is stored in the 'code_bytes' attribute. The conversion to bytes is primarily for validation purposes, allowing for byte-level comparisons or operations if needed.

The 'lang' parameter specifies the programming language of the source code as a string. This information can be crucial for applying language-specific rules and functionalities during further processing.

Additionally, an empty list named 'parsed_lines' is initialized in this method. This list is intended to store parsed lines of code but remains empty at the time of initialization. It will likely be populated with data by methods implemented elsewhere in the class hierarchy or subclasses.

Note: When creating a new instance of BaseCodeContext, ensure that you provide a valid TSTree object for 'tree', the actual source code as a string for 'code', and the correct language identifier for 'lang'. The 'parsed_lines' attribute is initialized but not used within this method; it serves as a placeholder for future use.
***
### FunctionDef validate_token(node, line_text, code_bytes)
**validate_token**: This function checks the integrity of a token by comparing its text representation extracted from two different sources: one derived from line text and another from byte positions within the entire code.

parameters:
· node: An instance of TSNode representing the syntax tree node corresponding to the token being validated.
· line_text: A string containing the full text of the line where the token resides.
· code_bytes: A bytes object representing the complete source code, used for extracting the token's byte span.

Code Description: The function begins by extracting the start and end points (line numbers and character positions) from the node. It then calculates the corresponding byte positions within the entire code. Using these positions, it slices both the line text and the full code bytes to obtain the substring or subsequence of bytes that represent the token in each context.

The function compares the byte representation of the token extracted from its line (converted to bytes) with the byte representation directly sliced from the full code. If they do not match, it indicates a discrepancy between the node's reported positions and the actual content at those positions within the code. This could suggest an error in parsing or data corruption.

If the mismatch occurs on a single line (start_line_no equals end_line_no), the function logs this as a debug message, providing details about the node, its byte span, its line span, and the full line text for further inspection.

Note: The validate_token function is called within the _parse method of BaseCodeContext. This method processes each token in the syntax tree to ensure that all tokens are correctly aligned with their respective lines in the source code and that their positions are accurately reported by the syntax tree nodes. By validating each token, the system ensures data consistency and reliability during parsing and transformation phases.
***
### FunctionDef is_multiline_token(token)
**is_multiline_token**: This function determines whether a given token spans multiple lines within the source code.

parameters:
· token: An instance of the Token class, which encapsulates a tree-sitter Node representing a syntax tree node and provides additional properties for easier manipulation and access of token data.

Code Description: The function takes a single parameter, `token`, which is an object of the Token class. It retrieves the starting line number (`start_line_no`) and ending line number (`end_line_no`) from the `node` attribute of the token. These values are accessed via the `start_point[0]` and `end_point[0]` properties of the node, respectively. The function then checks if these two line numbers are different. If they are, it indicates that the token spans across multiple lines, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the token is contained within a single line.

Note: This function is particularly useful in scenarios where understanding the physical layout of tokens in the source code is necessary, such as when analyzing or transforming code structures. It can be used to identify multi-line strings, comments, or other constructs that extend across multiple lines.

Output Example: If the token represents a string literal that starts on line 10 and ends on line 12, `is_multiline_token(token)` would return `True`. Conversely, if the token is a single keyword like "def" located entirely on line 5, the function would return `False`.
***
### FunctionDef assign_token_to_line(self, node, line_tokens)
**assign_token_to_line**: This function is designed to implement a language-specific strategy for assigning tokens to their corresponding lines within a source code file. It takes a node from a syntax tree and a dictionary mapping line numbers to lists of tokens, then assigns tokens to lines based on the specific rules defined by the programming language being processed.

**parameters**:
· node: A TSNode object representing a node in the syntax tree. This node contains information about a particular element in the source code.
· line_tokens: A dictionary where keys are line numbers (integers) and values are lists of tokens that belong to those lines. Tokens are represented as elements within these lists.

**Code Description**: The function is currently defined with a placeholder implementation that raises a `NotImplemented` error, indicating that it needs to be overridden by subclasses in order to provide the specific logic for token assignment based on the programming language being analyzed. This design allows for flexibility and extensibility, as different languages may have varying rules about how tokens are associated with lines of code.

The function is called within the `_parse` method of the `BaseCodeContext` class. In this context, it is used to traverse a syntax tree (starting from its root node) and populate the `line_tokens` dictionary by assigning each token in the tree to its corresponding line number based on the language-specific rules implemented in the subclass.

The `_parse` method first initializes an empty dictionary for `line_tokens` and splits the source code into lines. It then calls `assign_token_to_line`, passing the root node of the syntax tree and the `line_tokens` dictionary as arguments. After this, it ensures that all lines, including those without tokens (such as empty lines), are represented in the `line_tokens` dictionary. The method then sorts the line tokens by line number, validates each token's position within its respective line, creates a list of `Token` objects for each line, and finally constructs a list of `CodeLineTokens` objects that encapsulate all the information about each line of code.

**Note**: Usage points include any subclass of `BaseCodeContext` where this method is implemented to provide language-specific token assignment logic. This function is crucial for parsing source code into a structured format that can be analyzed or transformed further, making it an essential part of the code extraction and transformation process.
***
### FunctionDef _parse(self)
**_parse**: This function processes the source code by parsing it into a structured format where each line of code is associated with its corresponding tokens. It ensures that all tokens are correctly aligned with their respective lines and validates their positions within the source code.

parameters:
· None: The _parse method does not take any parameters directly but operates on attributes of the BaseCodeContext instance, such as `self.code`, `self.tree.root_node`, and `self.code_bytes`.

**Code Description**: The function begins by initializing a dictionary `line_tokens` to map line numbers to lists of tokens. It then splits the source code into individual lines using the newline character `\n`. 

Next, it calls the `assign_token_to_line` method, passing the root node of the syntax tree and the `line_tokens` dictionary. This method is intended to populate `line_tokens` with tokens assigned to their respective lines based on language-specific rules.

The function then iterates over all line numbers in `line_texts`. If a line number does not exist as a key in `line_tokens`, it means that no tokens were collected for that line, likely because the line is empty. In such cases, an empty list is inserted into `line_tokens` for that line number.

After ensuring all lines are represented in `line_tokens`, the function sorts the dictionary items by line number to maintain order. It then iterates over these sorted items, extracting the text of each line and creating a list of tokens for that line. For each token node associated with a line, it calls the `validate_token` method to ensure the token's start and end positions are consistent with its byte location within the source code. If validation passes, a Token object is created and added to the list of tokens for that line.

Finally, the function constructs a list of CodeLineTokens objects, each representing a line of code along with its associated tokens and text. It asserts that the number of parsed lines matches the total number of lines in the source code before returning this list.

**Note**: This method is crucial for parsing source code into a structured format that can be analyzed or transformed further. It ensures data consistency by validating token positions and handles empty lines appropriately. The function is called within the constructor of subclasses like PythonCodeContext to parse the source code after syntax tree construction.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the return value could be:
```
[
    CodeLineTokens(line_no=0, tokens=[Token('def'), Token(' '), Token('my_function')], text='def my_function'),
    CodeLineTokens(line_no=1, tokens=[], text=''),
    CodeLineTokens(line_no=2, tokens=[Token('('), Token(')'), Token(':')], text='():')
]
```
This example shows a parsed representation of three lines of Python code, where the second line is empty. Each `CodeLineTokens` object contains the line number, a list of `Token` objects representing the tokens in that line, and the full text of the line.
***
### FunctionDef iter_token(tokenized_code_lines)
**iter_token**: This function iterates over a list of tokenized code lines, yielding tokens under specific conditions related to their node attributes.

**parameters**:
· tokenized_code_lines: A list of CodeLineTokens objects, where each object contains a sequence of tokens from a line of code.

**Code Description**: The function `iter_token` processes a list of tokenized code lines. It maintains a reference to the previous token (`prev`) as it iterates through each token in every `CodeLineTokens` object within the provided list. For each token, if `prev` is not None and the node attribute of the current token differs from that of `prev`, the function yields the current token. This mechanism ensures that tokens are yielded only when there is a change in their node attribute compared to the previous token, which can be useful for filtering or processing tokens based on structural changes in the code.

**Note**: The function is utilized by methods such as `tokens` and `tokens_from_line_no` within the `BaseCodeContext` class. These methods call `iter_token` with specific slices of parsed lines to retrieve all tokens or tokens from a certain line, respectively. This setup allows for flexible token retrieval based on different requirements in code analysis or transformation tasks.
***
### FunctionDef tokens(self)
**tokens**: This function retrieves all tokens from a stream of parsed lines by utilizing the `iter_token` method.
parameters:
· None: The `tokens` method does not accept any parameters directly; it operates on the instance's `parsed_lines` attribute.

Code Description: The `tokens` method is designed to provide access to all tokens within a code context. It achieves this by invoking the `iter_token` function with the `parsed_lines` attribute of the current instance as its argument. The `parsed_lines` attribute is expected to be a list of `CodeLineTokens` objects, each representing a line of code that has been tokenized. By passing these lines to `iter_token`, the method effectively iterates through all tokens in the context, yielding them under conditions specified by `iter_token`. This setup allows for efficient and flexible retrieval of tokens based on structural changes in the code.

Note: The `tokens` method is particularly useful when a comprehensive list of tokens is required for further analysis or transformation tasks. It leverages the functionality provided by `iter_token`, which filters tokens based on changes in their node attributes, ensuring that only relevant tokens are yielded.

Output Example: Assuming the `parsed_lines` attribute contains tokenized lines from a simple Python function definition, the output might look like this:

```
def
my_function
(
param1
:
int
)
:
return
param1
+
1
``` 

Each of these elements would be yielded as individual tokens by the `tokens` method, provided they meet the conditions set in the `iter_token` function.
***
### FunctionDef tokens_from_line_no(self, line_no)
**tokens_from_line_no**: This function retrieves tokens starting from a specified line number within the context of a parsed code file.
parameters:
· line_no: An integer representing the line number from which to start retrieving tokens.

Code Description: The `tokens_from_line_no` method is designed to fetch tokens from a specific line in a parsed code document. It leverages the `iter_token` function, passing it a slice of the `parsed_lines` attribute starting from the specified `line_no`. This allows for efficient retrieval of tokens beginning at any given line, facilitating targeted analysis or transformation tasks.

The method assumes that `self.parsed_lines` is a list where each element corresponds to a line in the parsed code and contains tokenized information about that line. By slicing this list starting from `line_no`, it effectively narrows down the scope of tokens to be processed by `iter_token`.

Note: This function is particularly useful when developers need to analyze or manipulate specific sections of code rather than processing the entire document at once. It integrates seamlessly with other methods in the `BaseCodeContext` class that handle token retrieval and manipulation.

Output Example: If `parsed_lines` contains tokenized information for lines 1 through 10, calling `tokens_from_line_no(5)` would result in an iterator yielding tokens from line 5 to line 10. The exact output depends on the content of these lines and how they are tokenized.
***
### FunctionDef lines(self)
**lines**: Retrieve all lines from the parsed content.
parameters:
· None: This function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `lines` method is a generator function designed to yield each line of code along with its corresponding line number from the parsed content stored in `self.parsed_lines`. It iterates over each element in `self.parsed_lines`, where each element (`clt`) represents a line of code. For each iteration, it yields a tuple containing two elements: `clt.line_no` (the line number) and `clt.text` (the text content of the line). This method is useful for accessing lines of code in an iterative manner without loading all lines into memory at once.

Note: The `lines` function is utilized by other parts of the system, such as in the `num_preceding_chars` method of the `BaseFunction` class. In this context, it helps to calculate the total number of characters that appear before a specific function definition starts by iterating through lines until reaching the start line number of the function. This demonstrates how `lines` can be used to perform operations that require sequential access to code lines while maintaining efficiency by not loading all lines into memory simultaneously.
***
### FunctionDef num_of_lines(self)
**num_of_lines**: This function returns the total number of lines present in the parsed source code stored within an instance of BaseCodeContext.
parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The num_of_lines method is a simple property-like function designed to provide quick access to the count of lines that have been parsed and are currently stored in the self.parsed_lines attribute. This attribute is expected to be a list where each element represents a line from the source code being analyzed or processed. By using the len() function on this list, num_of_lines efficiently calculates and returns the number of elements (lines) it contains.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to know the total number of lines in a parsed file for metrics, analysis, or validation purposes. This method provides a straightforward way to retrieve this information without needing to manually count the lines.

Output Example: If self.parsed_lines contains ['def function():', '    return 1', '# comment'], then calling num_of_lines() would return 3, indicating there are three lines in the parsed source code.
***
### FunctionDef syntax_error(self)
**syntax_error**: This function checks whether there is a syntax error present in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the parsed code.
parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `syntax_error` method performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the AST to identify if any node has a type marked as "ERROR", which indicates a syntax error. It starts from the root node and recursively checks each child node. If it finds an "ERROR" type node, it immediately returns True, indicating that there is a syntax error in the code. The function handles exceptions, particularly those related to exceeding the maximum recursion depth, by returning True as well, assuming such cases are indicative of parsing issues.

Note: This method is crucial for determining if parsed code contains syntax errors before proceeding with further analysis or transformations. It is used in contexts where valid ASTs are required for operations like file-level context extraction and initializing Python code contexts.

Output Example: If the AST does not contain any nodes marked as "ERROR" and recursion depth issues do not occur, the function returns False, indicating no syntax errors were found. Conversely, if an "ERROR" node is encountered or a recursion depth exception is raised, it returns True, signaling the presence of a syntax error.
#### FunctionDef dfs_check(node)
**dfs_check**: This function checks if a given node in an abstract syntax tree (AST) contains any unparseable elements by performing a depth-first search (DFS).

parameters:
· node: The current node in the AST that is being checked for parsing errors.

Code Description: The function `dfs_check` is designed to traverse through nodes of an abstract syntax tree using a depth-first search approach. It starts at a given node and checks if this node has a type attribute set to "ERROR", which indicates that it cannot be parsed correctly. If such a condition is met, the function immediately returns True, signaling the presence of an unparseable element.

If the current node does not have an error type, the function then iterates over all its children nodes and recursively calls `dfs_check` on each child. This recursive call allows the function to explore deeper into the tree structure. If any recursive call to `dfs_check` returns True (indicating that a child node or one of its descendants is unparseable), the function also returns True, propagating the error status up the call stack.

If none of the nodes in the subtree rooted at the current node have an "ERROR" type, and no recursive calls return True, then `dfs_check` concludes by returning False. This indicates that all nodes in the subtree are parseable.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where one needs to validate the integrity of a parsed code structure or when debugging issues related to parsing errors in source code. The function is particularly useful in compilers and interpreters where maintaining correct syntax is crucial for proper execution of programs.

Output Example: If the AST contains an unparseable node, `dfs_check` will return True as soon as it encounters this node during its traversal. For example, if the input node is part of a tree that includes an "ERROR" type node at any depth, the function would return True. Conversely, if all nodes in the subtree are parseable (i.e., none have their type set to "ERROR"), `dfs_check` will return False, indicating no parsing issues were found.
***
***
### FunctionDef max_line_length(self)
**max_line_length**: This function calculates and returns the maximum line length from a given block of code without performing any parsing operations.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters directly; it operates on the `code` attribute of the class instance.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The `max_line_length` method is designed to determine the longest line in terms of character count within a block of code. It achieves this by first splitting the entire code string into individual lines using the newline character (`\n`) as the delimiter. For each line obtained from this split operation, it calculates the length and stores these lengths in a list called `lengths`. Finally, it returns the maximum value found in the `lengths` list, which corresponds to the longest line's length.

Note: Usage points.
This function is utilized within the initialization method of the `PythonCodeContext` class. Specifically, it checks if the maximum line length of the provided code does not exceed a predefined constant (`PY_MAX_LINE_LENGTH`). If this condition is met and there are no syntax errors in the code, the parsing process proceeds.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If the input code consists of the following lines:
```
def example_function():
    print("This is a test.")
    another_line_here = "Shorter"
```
The `max_line_length` function would return `25`, as the longest line `"def example_function():"` contains 25 characters.
***
### FunctionDef get_token_line_no(self, token)
**get_token_line_no**: This function retrieves the line number of a given token within its source code.
parameters:
· token: An instance of the Token class, which encapsulates a tree-sitter Node representing a syntax tree node and provides additional functionality for easier manipulation and access of token data.

Code Description: The get_token_line_no method accepts a single parameter, 'token', which is an object of the Token class. This class wraps around a tree-sitter Node to provide convenient access to various properties related to the token's position in the source code. Inside the function, it accesses the node attribute of the provided token, which is a TSNode instance representing the syntax tree node associated with the token. The method then retrieves the start_point from this node, which is a tuple containing two integers: the line number and the column number where the token begins in the source code. It extracts the first element of this tuple (the line number) using index [0] and returns it as an integer.

Note: This function is useful for determining the exact location of tokens within their respective source files, which can be critical for tasks such as error reporting, syntax highlighting, or any form of static code analysis that requires positional information about tokens.

Output Example: If the token represents the keyword "def" at the start of a function definition on line 5, column 0 in the source code, calling get_token_line_no with this token would return the integer value 5.
***
### FunctionDef get_line(self, line_no)
**get_line**: Retrieves a specific line from the parsed lines of code based on the given line number.
parameters:
· line_no: An integer representing the line number of the code line to be retrieved.

Code Description: The function get_line is designed to fetch a particular line of code identified by its line number. It accesses an internal list or dictionary, `parsed_lines`, which contains all lines of parsed code where each element is expected to be an instance of `CodeLineTokens`. The function uses the provided `line_no` parameter as an index to retrieve the corresponding `CodeLineTokens` object from `parsed_lines`. An assertion checks that the retrieved line's number matches the requested `line_no`, ensuring data integrity. Finally, it returns the `CodeLineTokens` object representing the specified line of code.

Note: This function assumes that the `parsed_lines` attribute is properly initialized and contains valid entries for all expected line numbers. It also expects that each entry in `parsed_lines` has a `line_no` attribute that matches its index or key, depending on how `parsed_lines` is structured (as a list or dictionary).

Output Example: Assuming `CodeLineTokens` holds information about tokens in the code line, an example return value could be:
```
CodeLineTokens(line_no=5, tokens=['def', 'example_function(', ')', ':'])
``` 
This represents line number 5 of the parsed source code, which contains a function definition.
***
### FunctionDef get_window_by_line(self, start_line_no, end_line_no)
**get_window_by_line**: This function retrieves a slice of lines from the parsed source code based on specified start and end line numbers.

parameters:
· start_line_no: An integer representing the starting line number (inclusive) for the window.
· end_line_no: An integer representing the ending line number (exclusive) for the window.

Code Description: The function `get_window_by_list` is designed to extract a specific range of lines from a parsed source code. It utilizes list slicing on the `parsed_lines` attribute, which is assumed to be a list where each element represents a line in the source code as an object of type `CodeLineTokens`. The slice starts at `start_line_no` and ends just before `end_line_no`, effectively capturing all lines within this range. This method is particularly useful for extracting specific sections of code, such as function signatures or class definitions, when their start and end line numbers are known.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where a developer needs to isolate parts of the source code for analysis, transformation, or extraction purposes. For example, it can be used to retrieve the body of a function or the signature of a class by specifying appropriate line numbers.

Output Example: Assuming `parsed_lines` contains lines from a Python script and we call `get_window_by_line(2, 5)`, if the third, fourth, and fifth lines are "def my_function():", "    print('Hello')", and "    return None", respectively, the function will return a list of `CodeLineTokens` objects corresponding to these three lines. The exact content would depend on how `CodeLineTokens` is structured but might look something like this in terms of line text: ["def my_function():", "    print('Hello')", "    return None"].

### FunctionDef get_node_window(self, node)
**get_node_window**: This function retrieves a window of lines from the parsed source code corresponding to a given syntax tree node.

parameters:
· node: An instance of TSNode representing the syntax tree node for which the line window is required.

Code Description: The function calculates the start and end line numbers of the provided syntax tree node by accessing its `start_point` and `end_point` attributes. These points are tuples where the first element represents the line number in the source code. Using these line numbers, it slices the `parsed_lines` attribute of the class instance to extract the lines that correspond to the given node. The function then returns this slice as a list of lines.

Note: This function is used by other methods such as `get_code_block` and `body` in different classes (`BaseFileContext` and `PythonFunction`, respectively) to obtain specific parts of the source code for further processing or analysis.

Output Example: If the node corresponds to lines 5 through 7 in the parsed source code, the function might return a list like this:
['def example_function():', '    print("Hello, world!")', ''] 
This output represents the lines from line number 5 to 7 of the source file, including any trailing newline characters.

### FunctionDef find_last_code_lines(self, num_lines)
**find_last_code_lines**: This function retrieves the last N lines of valid code from a parsed list of lines within the context of a source file being analyzed.

parameters:
· num_lines: An integer representing the number of last valid code lines to be retrieved.

Code Description: The purpose of this function is to extract the specified number of lines that contain actual executable or meaningful code from a reversed copy of the parsed lines. It first creates a reverse copy of the list of parsed lines and iterates through it, checking each line using the `is_code_line` method to determine if it contains valid code. Lines identified as containing code are added to a new list until the desired number of lines is reached or all lines have been checked. The resulting list of valid code lines is then reversed back to its original order before being returned.

Note: This function relies on the `is_code_line` method, which must be implemented in subclasses of BaseCodeContext to accurately determine whether a line contains executable code. Developers should ensure that their implementations of `is_code_line` are robust and correctly identify lines of code.

Output Example: If the parsed lines include comments, whitespace, and actual code, and if `num_lines` is set to 2, the function might return something like:
```
[
    CodeLineTokens(line_no=45, tokens=['def', 'example_function(', ')']),
    CodeLineTokens(line_no=46, tokens=['return', 'True'])
]
```
This example assumes that lines 45 and 46 contain valid code, while other lines may not.

### FunctionDef is_code_line(self, line_no)
**is_code_line**: This function checks whether a specified line number corresponds to a line of actual code within the context of a source file being analyzed.

parameters:
· line_no: An integer representing the line number in the source file that needs to be checked.

Code Description: The purpose of this function is to determine if a given line number contains executable or meaningful code, as opposed to comments, whitespace, or other non-code elements. This function is crucial for tasks such as parsing and analyzing source code where only lines containing actual code are relevant. However, the current implementation raises a NotImplemented error, indicating that it is an abstract method intended to be overridden by subclasses of BaseCodeContext. Subclasses should provide a concrete implementation that accurately identifies whether a line number corresponds to a line of code.

Note: This function is utilized in the find_last_code_lines method, which retrieves the last N lines of valid code from a parsed list of lines. The is_code_line method is called within this process to filter out non-code lines before reversing and returning the desired number of code lines. Developers implementing subclasses of BaseCodeContext should ensure that they provide an appropriate implementation for is_code_line to maintain the functionality of methods like find_last_code_lines.

### FunctionDef check_task_exists_in_code(self, prompt, groundtruth)
**check_task_exists_in_code**: This function checks whether a specific combination of prompt and groundtruth strings can be found within the original code, ensuring that no modifications have been made to the code.

parameters:
· prompt: A string representing the initial part of the task or code snippet.
· groundtruth: A string representing the expected output or result corresponding to the prompt.

Code Description: The function takes two string inputs, 'prompt' and 'groundtruth', and concatenates them. It then searches for this concatenated string within the original code stored in the `self.code` attribute of the class instance. If the combined string is not found (i.e., the `find` method returns -1), a ValueError is raised with the message "Task Instance are not in file". If the string is found, indicating that the task and its expected result exist in the original code without modification, the function returns True.

Note: This function is useful for verifying that specific tasks or code snippets, along with their expected results, remain intact in a given piece of code. It helps ensure data integrity and correctness in scenarios where the original code should not be altered.

Output Example: If the concatenated string 'prompt + groundtruth' exists within `self.code`, the function will return True. For instance, if `self.code` contains "Calculate sum 1+2=3" and the inputs are prompt="Calculate sum 1+2=" and groundtruth="3", the function will return True. If the string is not found, a ValueError with the message "Task Instance are not in file" will be raised.

### FunctionDef _dfs(self, node, node_types, callback)
**_dfs**: Helper function to traverse a parsed Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using Depth-First Search (DFS).

**parameters**:
· node: The current node in the AST being visited, of type TSNode.
· node_types: A list of strings representing the types of nodes that should trigger the callback function.
· callback: A callable function to be executed when a node matches one of the specified types.

**Code Description**: This function performs a depth-first search traversal on an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It starts from the given `node` and recursively visits each child node. If the type of the current node is found in the `node_types` list, it calls the provided `callback` function with the current node as its argument. The recursion ensures that all nodes are visited, allowing for comprehensive traversal of the AST structure.

The `_dfs` function is a fundamental utility within the codebase, enabling various functionalities such as collecting specific types of nodes or extracting particular elements from the source code. It serves as a backbone for methods like `collect_nodes`, which gathers nodes of certain types, and others that identify return statements, assignments, and instance variables in Python classes.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where traversal of an AST is required to analyze or manipulate the structure of source code programmatically. This function is particularly useful when developers need to perform operations on specific elements within a parsed codebase, such as extracting function definitions, identifying return statements, or analyzing variable assignments.

### FunctionDef collect_nodes(self, node_types)
**collect_nodes**: This function collects all nodes from an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that match specified node types.

**parameters**:
· node_types: A list of strings where each string represents a type of node to be collected from the AST.

**Code Description**: The `collect_nodes` method is designed to gather specific types of nodes from an AST. It initializes an empty list named `result` to store the matching nodes. Inside this function, a nested callback function `_cb` is defined, which appends each matched node to the `result` list. The method then calls the `_dfs` (Depth-First Search) helper function, starting from the root of the AST (`self.tree.root_node`). The `_dfs` function traverses the tree recursively, checking if each node's type matches any in the provided `node_types`. If a match is found, the callback function `_cb` is invoked, adding the node to the `result` list. After the traversal completes, the method returns the `result` list containing all nodes of the specified types.

**Note**: This function is particularly useful when developers need to analyze or manipulate specific elements within a parsed codebase, such as extracting function definitions, identifying return statements, or analyzing variable assignments. It serves as a foundational utility for tasks that require targeted node collection from an AST.

**Output Example**: If `node_types` includes 'function_definition' and the AST contains three function definition nodes, the output would be a list of these three TSNode objects representing the function definitions.
#### FunctionDef _cb(n)
**_cb**: This function appends a node to a result list.
parameters:
· n: Represents the node to be appended to the result list.

Code Description: The function _cb is designed to take a single argument, `n`, which is expected to be a node of some kind (the exact nature of the node depends on the context in which this function is used). Inside the function, there is an operation that appends this node `n` to a list named `result`. The `result` list must be defined in a scope that is accessible to _cb, such as a global variable or a closure. This function does not return any value; its primary purpose is to modify the `result` list by adding the provided node.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where nodes need to be collected during tree traversal operations, such as parsing abstract syntax trees (ASTs) in compilers or interpreters. The function _cb can serve as a callback for functions that traverse these structures and collect specific types of nodes into a list for further processing. It is important to ensure that the `result` list is properly initialized before using this function to avoid runtime errors related to undefined variables.
