## FunctionDef process_edges(retrieved_edges)
**process_edges**: This function processes a dictionary of edges to reformat them into a list of lists where each sublist contains details about an edge.

parameters:
· retrieved_edges: A dictionary where keys are node identifiers (heads) and values are lists of tuples representing edges connected to the head node. Each tuple contains another tuple with two elements (likely source and destination node identifiers) and a third element which could be an attribute or weight of the edge.

Code Description: The function iterates over each key in the `retrieved_edges` dictionary, treating each key as a 'head' node. For every head node, it further iterates through its associated list of edges. Each edge is represented by a tuple where the first element is itself a tuple containing two identifiers (possibly source and destination nodes) and the second element could be an attribute or weight of that edge. The function constructs a new list `proc_edges` where each entry is a flattened version of these tuples, specifically [head node, source node, destination node, edge attribute/weight]. This reformatted data structure simplifies further processing or analysis of the edges.

Note: Usage points indicate this function is called within `create_test_samples` to process and reformat edges retrieved from a file. The processed edges are then used alongside nodes in creating test samples for some kind of evaluation or testing procedure, possibly related to code clone detection or similar functionality.

Output Example: If `retrieved_edges` were {'A': [(('B', 'C'), 1)], 'D': [(('E', 'F'), 2)]}, the function would return [['A', 'B', 'C', 1], ['D', 'E', 'F', 2]]. Each sublist represents an edge with its head node, source node, destination node, and some attribute or weight.
## FunctionDef post_squeeze_nodes(nodes, edges)
**post_squeeze_nodes**: This function processes a list of nodes and edges to merge specific types of nodes based on predefined edge types, effectively compressing the graph representation by combining related nodes into single entities.

parameters:
· nodes: A list of node strings representing various elements such as functions or classes.
· edges: A list of edges connecting these nodes. Each edge is represented as a list containing indices of the head and tail nodes, along with additional metadata about the connection type.

Code Description: The function begins by initializing several data structures to manage the merging process. It first de-duplicates the edges to ensure each unique connection is only considered once. Then, it creates a more concrete representation of these edges by replacing node indices with their corresponding string values from the nodes list.

The core logic involves iterating over the edges and checking if they match any edge types specified in the `EDGE_TYPES_TO_SQEEZE` constant (not shown in the provided code snippet). If an edge matches, it indicates that the head and tail nodes should be merged into a single node. This new node is constructed by concatenating the head and tail strings with a newline character in between, prefixed by a hash symbol to distinguish it as a merged entity.

The function maintains a mapping of original nodes to their merged counterparts using `squeezed_nodes_map`. It also tracks redundant nodes that are part of merges to avoid including them separately later. After processing all edges, the function updates the list of nodes and edges to reflect these changes. Nodes involved in merges are replaced with their merged versions, while standalone nodes remain unchanged. Edges are updated to point to the new node indices.

Finally, the function returns two lists: the updated list of nodes and the updated list of edges, both reflecting the compressed graph structure.

Note: This function is typically used as a post-processing step after retrieving nodes and edges from a codebase or similar data source. It helps in reducing redundancy and simplifying the representation by merging related nodes based on specific edge types.

Output Example:
Given the following input:
nodes = ["file.func_name", "def func_name(): …", "other_node"]
edges = [[0, 'type_to_squeeze', 'metadata', 1], [2, 'other_type', 'more_metadata', 0]]

The function might return:
squeezed_nodes = ['#file.func_name\ndef func_name(): …', 'other_node']
squeezed_edges = [['0', 'type_to_squeeze', 'metadata', '0']]
## FunctionDef create_test_samples(pair)
**create_test_samples**: This function generates test samples by combining prompts from a prompt file with corresponding retrieved nodes and edges from another file. It processes these elements to create a structured format suitable for further analysis, such as code clone detection.

parameters:
· pair: A tuple containing two strings - the path to the prompt file and the path to the retrieved node file.

Code Description: The function starts by initializing an empty list `samples` to store the processed test samples. It then opens and reads the retrieved node file, parsing its JSON content to extract project location, nodes, and edges. Next, it reads the prompt file line by line, converting each line from a JSON string into a dictionary.

For each prompt in the prompts list, the function creates a new sample dictionary `s`. This dictionary includes the original prompt text and ground truth information. It also retrieves the relevant nodes and edges for the current prompt's metadata file path (adjusted relative to the project location). If no nodes are found, the loop continues to the next prompt.

The retrieved edges are processed using the `process_edges` function to reformat them into a list of lists. The nodes and edges are then further processed by the `post_squeeze_nodes` function to merge related nodes based on specific edge types, effectively compressing the graph representation. If no edges remain after this step, the loop continues.

The sample dictionary is updated with the metadata from the prompt and appended to the `samples` list. Finally, all samples are converted into JSON strings and joined together with newline characters, forming a single string that represents all test samples.

Note: This function is typically used as part of a larger process for creating datasets or evaluating systems related to code clone detection. It reads input files containing prompts and retrieved nodes/edges, processes these elements, and outputs structured test samples in JSON format.

Output Example: Given the following inputs:
- Prompt file content:
  {"prompt": "Find the function definition", "groundtruth": "def example_function(): pass", "metadata": {"file": "/path/to/project/file.py"}}
- Retrieved node file content (simplified):
  {
    "project_location": "/path/to/project/",
    "retrived_nodes": {"file.py": ["node1", "node2"]},
    "retrieved_edges": {"file.py": [("node1", ("node2", "type"), "attr")]}
  }

The function might return:
{"prompt": "Find the function definition", "groundtruth": "def example_function(): pass", "retrieved_nodes": ["#node1\nnode2"], "retrieved_edges": [["0", "type", "attr", "0"]], "metadata": {"file": "/path/to/project/file.py"}}
## FunctionDef prepend_locale(edges)
**prepend_locale**: This function processes a list of edges to collect unique entities by prepending a locale identifier to each entity under specific conditions. It is primarily used for experiments involving random entities.

**parameters**:
· edges: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an edge with keys "rel", "head", and "tail". The "rel" key indicates the relationship type between the head and tail entities.

**Code Description**: The function initializes an empty list named `entities` to store unique entity identifiers. It iterates over each element in the input list `edges`. For each edge, it checks if the relationship type ("rel") is included in a predefined set of types (`EDGE_TYPES_TO_SQEEZE`). If true, it appends the "head" entity to the `entities` list and constructs a new string by concatenating "#" with the "head" entity followed by a newline character and the "tail" entity. This constructed string is then appended to the `entities` list. If the relationship type is not in `EDGE_TYPES_TO_SQEEZE`, it simply appends both the "head" and "tail" entities to the `entities` list. After processing all edges, the function returns a list of unique entities by converting the `entities` list into an `OrderedDict` and then back to a list. This conversion ensures that duplicates are removed while maintaining the original order of first appearances.

**Note**: The function assumes the existence of a predefined set `EDGE_TYPES_TO_SQEEZE`, which should be defined elsewhere in the codebase for this function to work correctly. Developers must ensure that this set is properly initialized with appropriate relationship types before calling `prepend_locale`.

**Output Example**: Given an input list of edges like `[{"rel": "type1", "head": "entityA", "tail": "entityB"}, {"rel": "type2", "head": "entityC", "tail": "entityD"}]` and assuming `EDGE_TYPES_TO_SQEEZE` contains `"type1"`, the function would return a list such as `['entityA', '#entityA\nentityB', 'entityC', 'entityD']`. If `EDGE_TYPES_TO_SQEEZE` were empty, it would return `['entityA', 'entityB', 'entityC', 'entityD']`.
## FunctionDef main
**main**: This function serves as the entry point for generating test samples from specified input files. It orchestrates the reading of a prompt file and a retrieved entity file, processes these inputs to create structured test samples, and writes the resulting JSON-formatted string to an output file.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters are listed in the function signature; however, it relies on `args` which is expected to contain at least two attributes: `output_file`, specifying the path where the generated test samples will be written, and `prompt_file` and `retrieved_entity_file`, passed as a tuple to the `create_test_samples` function.

Code Description: The `main` function begins by opening the file specified in `args.output_file` in write mode. It then calls the `create_test_samples` function with a tuple containing the paths to the prompt file (`args.prompt_file`) and the retrieved entity file (`args.retrieved_entity_file`). This function is responsible for reading these files, processing their contents to generate structured test samples, and returning these samples as a single JSON-formatted string. The `main` function writes this string to the output file, appending a newline character at the end.

Note: Usage of this function requires that the `args` object be properly configured with the paths to the prompt file, retrieved entity file, and output file. This setup is typically done through command-line arguments or configuration files in larger applications. The `main` function acts as a bridge between input data processing (handled by `create_test_samples`) and output data storage, ensuring that the generated test samples are saved correctly for further use, such as in code clone detection systems.
