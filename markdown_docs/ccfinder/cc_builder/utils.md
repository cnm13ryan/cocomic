## FunctionDef config_logging(level, prefix, log_dir_path)
**config_logging**: This function configures the logging system to output log messages to both the console (stdout) and optionally to a file, based on the specified parameters.

parameters:
· level: The logging level that determines the severity of messages to be logged. If not provided, it defaults to DEBUG.
· prefix: A string used as part of the filename for the log file if logging to a file is enabled. Defaults to "log".
· log_dir_path: The directory path where the log file will be created. If this parameter is not provided or set to None, logging to a file will be disabled.

Code Description: The function starts by checking if a logging level has been specified; if not, it sets the default level to DEBUG. It then creates a formatter that specifies how the log messages should appear, including the timestamp, the severity of the message (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), and the actual message.

The root logger is retrieved using `logging.getLogger()`. To prevent multiple handlers from being added to the root logger when the function is called multiple times (which can happen if many models are running under a single process), the function checks if any handlers have already been registered. If they exist, it returns immediately without adding more handlers.

The logging level of the root logger is set according to the provided or default level. A StreamHandler is created and configured with the formatter to output log messages to stdout (the console). This handler is then added to the root logger.

If a directory path for log files has been specified, the function proceeds to create a file handler. It generates a timestamped filename using the provided prefix and the current date and time. A FileHandler is created with this filename and configured with the same formatter as the StreamHandler. The logging level of the file handler is set according to the provided or default level, and it is added to the root logger.

Note: This function should be called early in the application's startup process to ensure that all subsequent log messages are captured appropriately.

Output Example: When config_logging is called with `level=logging.INFO`, `prefix="app"`, and `log_dir_path="/var/log/myapp"`, it will configure logging to output INFO level (and higher severity) messages to both the console and a file named something like "app_2023-10-05_14:30:00.log" in the "/var/log/myapp" directory. The log entries will include timestamps, message levels, and the actual log messages.
## ClassDef ModuleSetForGraphRetrieval
**ModuleSetForGraphRetrieval**: This class extends `ModuleSet` and is designed to handle operations related to retrieving imports from Python modules for graph construction purposes.

**attributes**:
· path_list: A list of file paths representing Python modules.

**Code Description**: The `ModuleSetForGraphRetrieval` class initializes with a list of module paths, inheriting from the `ModuleSet` class. It includes a method `get_imports` which takes a module object and an optional boolean parameter `return_fqn`. This method is responsible for parsing import statements within the given module to identify imported modules and their full qualified names (FQNs). The imports are processed to distinguish between intra-package imports (based on the import level) and standard imports. Each identified import is checked against a set of known modules, and if valid, it is added to a list along with its path and FQN.

The `get_imports` method uses an internal helper function `_get_imported_module` to resolve imported module paths based on their FQNs. The method returns a list of tuples containing the import details (path, FQN, raw import statement).

**Note**: This class is utilized in functions such as `extract_node_edge_coarse_grained` and `retrieve_for_proj` for extracting import information from Python modules to build context graphs representing project dependencies.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of `get_imports` could be a list of tuples like this:
```
[
    ('/path/to/module1.py', 'package.module1', ('from package import module1', None, 0)),
    ('/path/to/submodule2.py', 'package.subpackage.submodule2', ('from package.subpackage import submodule2', None, 1))
]
```
Each tuple contains the path to the imported module, its FQN, and the raw import statement as a tuple.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path_list)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the ModuleSetForGraphRetrieval class with a list of paths.

parameters:
· path_list: A list containing file system paths that represent modules or files to be included in the graph retrieval process.

Code Description: The __init__ method is the constructor for the ModuleSetForGraphRetrieval class. It takes one parameter, path_list, which is expected to be a list of strings where each string represents a path to a module or file. This method calls the superclass's (presumably a parent class in an inheritance hierarchy) __init__ method with the provided path_list argument, allowing for any initialization logic defined in the superclass to be executed as well.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of ModuleSetForGraphRetrieval by passing a list of file paths. This setup is typically used when preparing to perform operations related to graph retrieval on specified modules or files within a codebase. Ensure that path_list contains valid and accessible paths for the intended functionality to work correctly.

### FunctionDef get_imports(self, module, return_fqn)
**get_imports**: This function retrieves a list of imports from a given module, optionally returning fully qualified names (FQNs) if specified.

**parameters**:
· module: The module object for which to retrieve imports.
· return_fqn: A boolean flag indicating whether to return the fully qualified name of the imported modules. It is set to False by default.

**Code Description**: The function starts by initializing an empty set `imports` and a list `imports_list`. It then calls `ast_imports(module.path)` to get raw import statements from the module's file path. For each import statement in `raw_imports`, it constructs a full import string by joining the 'from' and 'import' parts of the statement, if both are present.

The function checks for an import level which indicates intra-package imports. If an import level is found, it constructs an intra-package import name using the module's FQN (Fully Qualified Name) and the import level. It then attempts to retrieve the imported module using `_get_imported_module`. If no import level is present, it directly retrieves the imported module.

If a valid imported module is found, the function creates a tuple `imp` containing the path of the imported module, its FQN, and the raw import statement. This tuple is added to both the set `imports` (to ensure uniqueness) and the list `imports_list`. The function finally returns `imports_list`, which contains all unique imports for the given module.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where one needs to analyze dependencies or build graphs of module relationships within a project, as demonstrated in the calling functions `extract_node_edge_coarse_grained` and `retrieve_for_proj`.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
[
    ('/path/to/module1.py', 'package.module1', ('from package import', 'module1', None, 0)),
    ('/path/to/module2.py', 'package.subpackage.module2', ('from package.subpackage import', 'module2', None, 1))
]
```
